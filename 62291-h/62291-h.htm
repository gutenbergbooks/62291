<p class="ti0"><span class="capitular">I</span><span
class="smcap">n</span> this volume Wellington’s campaigning in 1812
is followed no further than the day (August 31st) on which he set out
from Madrid to drive back Clausel from the Douro. Reasons of space make
it impossible to include the siege of Burgos and the retreat which
followed. I had written the narrative of them, but found it impossible
to add six long chapters to the 620 pages already in print. The fact is
that, from the point of view of Wellington’s army, the year 1812 was
much more tightly packed with military events than any which had gone
before. In 1809 there was nothing important to chronicle after August:
in 1810 the Anglo-Portuguese did not come into the forefront of the
war till July, when Masséna had crossed the frontier and laid siege to
Almeida. In 1811 the year opened with a deadlock, which was only ended
by the commencement of Masséna’s retreat on March 9th, and concluded
with a similar deadlock which endured from July to December—interrupted
only by the short campaign of El Bodon and Aldea da Ponte, and this
covered only a week [Sept. 22-9]. In 1812 the great strategical
operations began on the first day of the year with the concentration
for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, and did not end till the last week of
November—which saw Wellington once more encamped under the walls of
that fortress. For eleven months on end he had been on the move, with
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[p. iv]</span> a brief rest in
cantonments between April 24th, the day when he gave up his pursuit of
Marmont in Northern Portugal, and the end of May, when his divisions
began to assemble again for the projected march on Salamanca. But for
this short break his operations were continuous, and the narrative of
them must of necessity be lengthy.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1812 cannot be called the greatest exhibition of
military genius in Wellington’s career: that distinction must be given
to the campaign of 1813. But it included the battle of Salamanca, the
most skilfully fought and the most decisive of all his victories,
‘the beating of forty thousand men in forty minutes.’ And its earlier
episodes, the two sudden strokes which ended in the storming of Ciudad
Rodrigo and of Badajoz, deserve the closest attention, as showing a
marvellous power of utilizing opportunities, and solving time-problems
of the most complicated sort. We shall see how Wellington, in face
of an enemy whose whole force was far superior to his own, so
conducted his operations that he had success in his hands before the
French armies could concentrate to overwhelm him. He would have been
victorious in 1812 even without the assistance that was given him
during the early months of the year by Napoleon’s misguided orders from
Paris, and in the summer by Soult’s repeated and deliberate refusal to
co-operate with King Joseph and Marmont for the general welfare of the
French cause in Spain. The limits of his success were largely extended
by those adventitious circumstances, but even without them he must
have achieved great things by force of the combinations which he had
prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[p. v]</span>The reader will find
that I have devoted a good deal of space to the precise working out
of the effect of Napoleon’s successive dispatches to Marmont, with
reference to the time at which each was received, and the influence
which it had on the Marshal’s movements. I am bound to say that careful
study has convinced me that Marmont’s justification of his own actions
from January to May, written in the fourth volume of his <i>Mémoires</i>, is
in the main fair and sensible, and that his criticism of his master’s
orders is as sound as it is lucid. Napier held the reverse opinion, but
his arguments in support of it are unconvincing: he is set on proving
his idol infallible at all costs, in this as in so many other cases.</p>

<p>I find myself equally at variance with Napier’s estimate of the
relative share of responsibility that falls on Soult upon the one
side and King Joseph and Jourdan on the other, for the disasters of
the summer of 1812. Jourdan’s plan of campaign, set out in his ‘May
<i>Mémoire</i>’ [see <a href="#Mem">pp. 303-11</a>], is a most clear-headed
and practicable scheme; the adoption of it would have reduced the
effect of Wellington’s strategy, and have set a limit to his successes.
Soult wrecked the whole scheme by wilful disobedience, which sinned
as much against military discipline as against common sense. The
counter-projects which he kept sending to Jourdan and the King were
founded on his own personal desires, not on a consideration of the
general situation in the Peninsula. Soult had been kind and courteous
to Napier while the historian was working at the French archives, and
had placed his own private papers at his disposition. I think that the
obligation was repaid by the mildness of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span> censures passed on the Marshal’s strange
behaviour in the summer of 1812.</p>

<p>A smaller proportion of the pages of this volume than of its
predecessors is occupied by the tale of those campaigns in the
Peninsula in which the British took no part. The year 1812 commences
with the surrender of Blake and the occupation of Valencia by the
French. When that great city and the army that had been driven into
it succumbed before Suchet’s attack, there was no longer any large
Spanish force in the field, and the operations of Lacy, Ballasteros,
and the Galicians are of only secondary importance and require no
great attention. Indeed the most effective service done against the
French in 1812 was that of the guerrilleros of Aragon, Cantabria, and
Navarre, whose obstinate resistance immobilized such a large portion of
the 230,000 imperial troops that lay in Spain. It will be noted that I
have had to devote a considerable number of pages to a much-neglected
episode of the summer of 1812—the campaigns against Caffarelli of the
irregular bands of the North, assisted by the fleet of Sir Home Popham.
It cannot be too often repeated that by immobilizing the 35,000 men of
the French Army of the North, they co-operated in the most effective
way with Wellington, and had their share in making the Salamanca
campaign a success for the allies.</p>

<p>I trust that I may have succeeded in making the topographical
details clear at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and more especially
Salamanca, all of which I have visited. I spent many hours going over
the ground at the Arapiles, and found that no mere map could have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span> enabled one to grasp the
situation in a satisfactory fashion.</p>

<p>I have once more to express my indebtedness to the owners of two
great files of Peninsular War documents, who were good enough to
place them at my disposition and to allow me to bring them to Oxford.
The D’Urban papers, lent to me by Mr. W. S. M. D’Urban, of Newport
House, near Exeter, the grandson of Sir Benjamin D’Urban, Beresford’s
Chief-of-the-Staff, continue to be of immense value all through 1812.
In the first half of the year Sir Benjamin was still at the Portuguese
head-quarters, and his diary and correspondence give the views of those
who had the best opportunity of knowing Wellington’s plans from the
inside. In June he was appointed to another post, that of commanding
the detached Portuguese cavalry brigade which covered Wellington’s left
flank in the Salamanca campaign; his notes as to his operations are
of extreme interest throughout June, July, and August; the narratives
which he drew up concerning his own fortunes at the battle of
Salamanca, and at the unfortunate combat of Majalahonda, have cleared
up several obscure problems, which no published material could have
enabled me to solve.</p>

<p>The papers of Sir George Scovell, lent me by his great-nephew,
Mr. G. Scovell, of Hove, had already begun to be of use to me in the
chronicle of 1811. But in 1812 they are of far greater importance,
since it was early in that year that Scovell was placed by Wellington
in charge of the toilsome duty of studying and decoding all French
captured dispatches written in cipher. The originals were left in his
hands, and only the interpre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[p.
viii]</span>tations, written out in full, were made over to the
Commander-in-Chief. These originals, often scraps of the smallest
dimensions made to be concealed in secret places about the person of
the bearer, are historical antiquities of the highest interest. Their
importance is so great that I have thought it necessary to give in <a
href="#ChapA_15">Appendix XV</a> a detailed account of them, of the
characteristics of the ‘Great Paris Cipher’—as Scovell called it—and of
the contents of each document.</p>

<p>I must mention, as in previous volumes, much kind help given to me
from abroad. The authorities of the Paris War Office have continued
to facilitate my researches among their bulky <i>cartons</i>. I have to
notice with sincere regret the death of my old friend, M. Martinien,
who did so much for me while I was compiling volumes III and IV of this
work. I much missed his guidance while working over the material of
1812 during the last two autumns. Colonel Juan Arzadun, of the Madrid
Artillery Museum, has continued to send me occasional information,
and I am specially obliged to Don Rafael Farias for procuring for me,
and making me a present of, that very rare document the 1822 ‘Estados
de los ejércitos españoles durante la guerra contra Bonaparte,’ a
collection of morning-states and tables of organization on which I
had in vain tried to lay hands during three successive visits to
Madrid. Another gift of the highest value was the complete set of
Beresford’s <i>Ordens do Dia</i> for the Portuguese army, ranging over the
whole war. This most useful series was presented to me by my friend
Mr. Rafael Reynolds, the companion of my last Portuguese tour,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[p. ix]</span> who found a copy of this
almost unprocurable file at Lisbon. I owe the two views of the field
of Salamanca to the camera of Mr. C. J. Armstrong, who sent them to me
along with many other interesting Peninsular photographs.</p>

<p>Three friends in England have continued to give me help of the
most invaluable kind. Mr. C. T. Atkinson, Fellow of Exeter College,
has looked through the whole of my proofs, and furnished me with
innumerable notes, which enabled me to add to the accuracy of my
narrative. He has also written me an appendix, <a href="#ChapA_14">No.
XIV</a>, concerning the English troops which in 1812 operated on the
East coast of Spain—and the others which formed the garrisons of
Gibraltar, Cadiz, and Tarifa. The Hon. John Fortescue, the historian
of the British army, has not only answered at length my queries on
many obscure problems, but has lent me the file of his transcripts
of French dispatches for 1812, a good many of which, and those of
high importance, were unknown to me. They were especially valuable
for Soult’s operations. Our narratives of the campaigns of 1812 will
appear almost simultaneously, and I think it will be found that all
our main opinions are in agreement. Major J. H. Leslie, R.A., has once
more contributed to this volume an ‘<a href="#ChapA_16">Artillery
Appendix</a>’ on the same lines as those for 1810 and 1811 in vols. III
and IV. His researches have always proved exhaustive and invaluable for
the history of his old Corps.</p>

<p>Lastly, the compiler of the Index, a task executed this summer under
very trying conditions, must receive, for the fifth time, my heartfelt
thanks for her labour of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[p. x]</span>As in previous
volumes, the critic may find some slight discrepancies between the
figures given with regard to strengths of regiments or losses in action
in the text and in the Appendices. This results from the fact that
many official documents contain incorrect arithmetic, which was only
discovered by the indefatigable proof-readers of the Clarendon Press,
who have tested all the figures, and found not infrequent (if minute)
errors. The text was printed off before the Appendices were finally
dealt with: where the numbers differ those in the Appendices are, of
course, to be preferred. But the worst discrepancies do not get beyond
units and tens.</p>

<p class="mt3"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—When every page of the
text, appendices, and index of this volume has been printed off, and
the final proofs of the preface are passing through my hands, comes
the news that Great Britain is most unexpectedly involved in a war
to which there can be no parallel named save the struggle that ended
just a hundred years ago. May her strength be used as effectively
against military despotism in the twentieth as it was in the nineteenth

Tarentum had been added to the list of the generals who had been
withdrawn and superseded for failure in Catalonia, another series of
operations had been begun in the East, which was destined to lead
directly to one more Spanish disaster, but indirectly to the ruin of
the French cause in Spain. For, as has already been pointed out in the
last pages of the last volume<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, it was to be the diversion by Napoleon’s
orders of French divisions eastward, from the borders of Portugal
to those of Valencia, that was to give Wellington his long-desired
opportunity of opening a successful offensive campaign against his
immediate opponents in the West. The fall of Valencia was to lead to
the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Emperor’s ambitious schemes for the
conquest of the kingdom of Valencia, the last district of eastern
Spain where he had as yet secured no solid foothold, had been deferred
perforce till Figueras fell, on August 19, 1811. As long as that great
fortress, which lies only a few miles from the French frontier, and
blocks the main road from Perpignan to Barcelona, had been maintained
against Macdonald by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p.
2]</span> resolute Martinez, it was impossible to take up a new
offensive campaign: all the disposable French troops in Catalonia were
immobilized around the stubborn garrison. At length the remnant of the
starving miqueletes had laid down their arms, and the troops which had
been for so long blockading them became disposable for the assistance
of Suchet, whose ‘Army of Aragon’ was to deliver the main blow against
Valencia.</p>

<p>Six days after the surrender of Figueras the news that the obstacle
to advance had been at last removed reached Paris, on August 25, and
on the same evening Berthier wrote, by his master’s orders, to bid
Suchet move forward: ‘Everything leads us to believe that Valencia is
in a state of panic, and that, when Murviedro has been taken and a
battle in the open field has been won, that city will surrender. If
you judge otherwise, and think that you must wait to bring up your
siege artillery for the attack on the place, or that you must wait
for a better season [i. e. early autumn] to commence the operation,
I must inform you that, in every case, it is the imperative order of
the Emperor that your head-quarters are to be on Valencian territory
on or about September 15th, and as far forward towards the city as
possible.’</p>

<p>The orders were feasible, and (as we shall see) were duly executed:
but Napoleon had committed his usual mistake of undervaluing the
tenacity of the Spanish enemy, whom he so deeply despised. Suchet set
his troops in motion on September 15th; he took Murviedro—but only
after a desperate siege of two months—he beat the army of Valencia in
a very decisive pitched battle, but the city by no means fulfilled the
Emperor’s prophecy by a prompt surrender. Fighting round its walls went
on for five weeks after Murviedro fell: and it was not till troops had
been brought to aid Suchet from very remote provinces, that he at last
compelled the capitulation of Valencia after the New Year of 1812 had
passed. Before the city yielded Wellington was on the move, far away
on the Portuguese frontier, and it was not many days after Suchet’s
aide-de-camp brought the glorious news of the capitulation of Valencia,
that Marmont’s aide-de-camp followed, with the wholly unexpected and
unwelcome tidings that the British had stormed Ciudad Rodrigo, and
that the hold of the French army on Leon and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span> Castile had been shaken. The one piece of
information was the complement and consequence of the other.</p>

<p>Suchet’s invasion of Valencia, in short, was a much harder and more
venturesome enterprise than his master had calculated. It was true that
the Spanish forces in front of him seemed in September wholly incapable
of holding him back. The Army of Catalonia had been reduced by a series
of disasters, culminating in the falls of Tarragona and Figueras, to a
mere remnant of 8,000 men, lurking in the high hills of the interior.
The Army of Valencia had made a miserable exhibition of itself during
the last year: it had brought no effective help to the Catalans, and
whenever any of its detachments came into contact with the French, they
had invariably suffered discreditable defeats, even when their numbers
were far greater than those of the invaders. Of all the armies of Spain
this was undoubtedly the one with the worst fighting reputation. It
was to small profit that the Captain-General was raising yet newer
and rawer battalions than those which already existed, to swell the
numbers, but not the efficiency, of his command. In July the nominal
total of the Valencian army, including the irregulars of the ‘flying
column’ of the Empecinado, had been just 30,000 men. By October
there were 36,000 under arms, including the new ‘Reserve Division<a
id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,’ whose six
battalions of recruits had only 135 officers to 6,000 men—an allowance
of one officer to 45 men, not much more than half of the proportion
that is necessary even among good veteran troops. But in truth the only
valuable fighting force that was present in the kingdom in September
was the infantry of the two weak divisions of the old Albuera army,
under Zayas and Lardizabal, whom Blake had brought round from Cadiz
with him, when he assumed command of the Eastern provinces. They did
not between them muster more than 6,000 bayonets, but were good old
troops, who were to distinguish themselves in the oncoming campaign.</p>

<p>In addition, it was possible that Valencia might be able to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> draw a few thousand men
to her aid from the depleted army of Murcia, which had suffered so
severely at Soult’s hands during the short campaign of the previous
August<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
But such assistance was purely problematical; if Soult should stir
again from the side of Andalusia, it would be impossible for General
Mahy to bring a single Murcian battalion to the succour of Blake. If,
by good fortune, he should not, only a fraction of Mahy’s small army
would be free, since the greater part of it would be required to watch
the Andalusian frontier, and to protect the great naval arsenal and
fortress of Cartagena.</p>

<p>If the regular troops only in eastern Spain had to be counted,
it was certain that Suchet could dispose of numbers superior to his
adversaries. The gross total of the French Army of Catalonia, where
General Decaen had now taken Macdonald’s place, was 30,000 men. That
of Suchet’s own ‘Army of Aragon’ was nearly 50,000, if garrisons,
sick, and drafts on the march are reckoned in it. With these deducted,
it could still supply about 31,000 men of all arms for the field.
But these were not the only resources available. On the upper Ebro,
in Navarre and western Aragon, were the two newly arrived divisions
of Reille and Severoli, which had entered Spain during the summer,
and had hitherto had no occupation save a little hunting of Mina’s
guerrilleros. These two divisions counted 15,000 fresh troops of good
quality, and Suchet reckoned on their assistance to cover his rear,
when he should begin his march on Valencia. Technically they belonged
to Dorsenne’s ‘Army of the North,’ but Severoli’s Italians had been
promised as a reinforcement for Aragon already, and when Suchet asked
for the grant of Reille’s division also it was not denied him. There
were 70,000 men in all to be taken into consideration when the attack
on Valencia was planned out.</p>

<p>No such force, of course, could be set aside for the actual
invasion. The reason why not half so many thousands could be utilized
for the projected stroke was that the Spanish War, as we have already
had to point out on many occasions, was not a normal struggle between
regular armies. The French had not only to conquer but to occupy every
province that they overrun. Wherever an adequate garrison was not left,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> guerrilleros and
miqueletes inundated the country-side, cut all communications, and
blockaded such small detachments as had been left far apart from the
main army. Suchet’s 70,000 men had to hold down Aragon and Catalonia,
at the same time that they undertook the further extension of their
master’s power on the Valencian side.</p>

<p>Decaen in Catalonia had 23,000 men fit for service, not including
sick and drafts on the march. Lacy’s little army was not more than
8,000 strong in September: yet Suchet dared not take away a man from
Catalonia. The large garrison of Barcelona, a whole division, and the
smaller garrisons of Gerona, Rosas, and Mont Louis absorbed nearly
half the effective total. The remainder were, as it turned out, not
strong enough to keep the Catalans in check, much less to prosecute
active offensive operations against them. It was in October, after
Suchet had started against Valencia, that Lacy carried out the series
of small successful raids against Igualada, Cervera, and Montserrat,
which have been spoken of in an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_4"
href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. We need not wonder, then,
that not a Frenchman was drawn from Catalonia: they were all wanted
on the spot to keep a tight hold on the turbulent principality. The
example of the surprise of Figueras in the last spring was sufficient
to prove the necessity of keeping every point strongly garrisoned, on
pain of possible disaster.</p>

<p>As to the Army of Aragon, it was far stronger than the Army of
Catalonia, but on the other hand it had even more fortresses to
garrison. Saragossa, Tortosa, Tarragona, Lerida, were large places,
each absorbing several battalions. In addition there were the
smaller strongholds of Jaca, Mequinenza, Monzon, Morella, requiring
care. All these were regular fortresses, but they did not exhaust
the list of points that must be firmly held, if the communications
of Suchet’s field-force with its distant base were to be kept free
and unhampered. Southern Aragon and the mountain-ganglion where the
borders of that kingdom and of Valencia and New Castile meet, in the
roughest country of the whole Spanish peninsula, had to be guarded.
For in this region lay the chosen hunting-ground of the guerrillero
bands of the Empecinado, Duran, and many other lesser chiefs:<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span> and Mina himself, from
his usual haunts in Navarre, not unfrequently led a raid far to the
south of the Ebro. Suchet had therefore to place garrisons in Teruel,
Daroca, Alcañiz, Calatayud, and Molina, none of which possessed modern
fortifications. The detachments left to hold them had to utilize a
large convent, a mediaeval castle, or some such post of defence, in
case they were attacked by the roving hordes of the enemy. Able to
protect themselves with ease against small parties, and to keep the
roads open under ordinary circumstances, they were exposed to serious
danger if the guerrilleros should mass themselves in force against any
one garrison—more especially if the bands should have been lent a few
cannon and gunners from the regular Spanish armies. For convents or old
castles could not resist artillery fire.</p>

<p>To cover his rear Suchet was forced to set aside one whole
division, that of Frère, thirteen battalions strong<a id="FNanchor_5"
href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, and mustering over 7,000
men, and immense detachments of the three other French divisions of
the Army of Aragon. The units told off for the field army left no less
than 6,800 able-bodied men (besides sick and convalescents) behind
them, while they took 22,000 to the front. Frère’s division remained
on the side of Western Catalonia, holding Lerida and Tortosa in force,
and the intermediate places with small posts. The detachments from
Musnier’s, Harispe’s, and Habert’s French, and from Palombini’s Italian
divisions, took charge of Southern Aragon, leaving a company here and a
battalion there. But the Marshal selected with great care the men who
were to march on the Valencian expedition: each regiment drafted its
most effective soldiers into the marching units, and left the recruits
and the old or sickly men in the garrisons. Thus the battalions used
in the oncoming campaign were rather weak, averaging not much over
450 men, but were composed entirely of selected veterans. The only
doubtful element taken forward was the so-called ‘Neapolitan Division’
of General Compère, which was only 1,500 strong—in reality a weak
brigade—and had no great reputation. But what was left of this corps
was its best part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span>—the
numerous men who wanted to desert had already done so, and its
weaklings were dead by this time. Of his cavalry Suchet took forward
almost the whole, leaving behind only two squadrons of the 4th Hussars
for the service between the garrisons, and of the other regiments
only the weakly men and horses<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Practically all his horse and field artillery
also went forward with him.</p>

<p>Of his own Army of Aragon, Suchet, as we have thus seen, left nearly
14,000 men ‘present under arms’ to cover his rear. But this was not
enough to make matters wholly secure, so untameable were the Aragonese
and Catalans with whom he had to deal. Indeed, if this force only had
been left to discharge the appointed task, it is clear, from subsequent
happenings, that he would have suffered a disaster during his absence
in Valencia. He asked from the Emperor the loan of half Reille’s
division from Navarre, as well as the prompt sending to the front of
Severoli’s Italians, who had been promised him as a reinforcement when
first they entered Spain. The petition was granted, and these troops
entered northern Aragon, and took charge of the places along the Ebro,
while the expeditionary army was on its way to Valencia. Most of them
were ultimately brought forward to the siege of the great city, and
without them neither could Aragon have been maintained nor Valencia
captured. Practically we may say that Suchet, at his original start,
took 26,000 men to beat the Valencians and capture their city, but
that he left nearly 30,000 more behind him, to hold down the provinces
already conquered and to deal with the guerrilleros.</p>

<p>Two main roads lead from the north to Valencia: the one, coming from
Tortosa and Catalonia, hugs the coast of the Mediterranean, from which
it is never more than a few miles distant. The other, far inland, and
starting from Saragossa, follows the valley of the Xiloca among the
hills of Southern Aragon, crosses the watershed beyond Teruel, and
descends to the sea near Murviedro, where it joins the coast-road only
a few miles north of Valencia. There is a third, and much inferior,
route between these two, which starts from Mequinenza on the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> Lower Ebro, crosses the
mountainous Valencian frontier near Morella, and comes down to the
coast at Castellon de la Plana, twenty miles north of Murviedro. Of
these roads the first was as good as any in Spain, and was suitable for
all manner of traffic: but it had the disadvantage of being flanked at
a distance of only two miles by the small but impregnable fortress of
Peniscola, which lies on a rocky headland thirty miles beyond Tortosa,
and of being absolutely blocked by the little town of Oropesa, twenty
miles further south. Oropesa was no more than a ruinous mediaeval
place, with two castles hastily repaired, without any modern works: but
since the road passed through it, no heavy guns or wagons starting from
Tortosa could get further south till its forts had been captured.</p>

<p>The second road, that from Aragon by Teruel and Murviedro, is marked
on contemporary maps as a post-route fit for all vehicles: but it
passed through a very mountainous country, and was much inferior as a
line of advance to the coast-road. It was not blocked by any fortress
in the hands of the Spaniards, but between Teruel and Segorbe it was
crossed by many ridges and ravines highly suitable for defence. The
third track, that by Morella, was unsuitable for wheeled traffic, and
could only be used by infantry and cavalry. Its one advantage was that
Morella, its central point, had been already for some time in French
hands, and contained a garrison and stores, which made it a good
starting-point for a marching column.</p>

    SUCHET’S CAMPAIGNS 1811-12 <span class="smcap">IN</span> VALENCIA
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">Suchet determined to use all three of these roads,
though such a plan would have been most hazardous against a wary and
vigorous enemy: for though they all converge in the end on the same
point, Murviedro, they are separated from each other by long stretches
of mountain, and have no cross-communications. In especial, the road
by Teruel was very distant from the other two, and any isolated column
taking it might find itself opposed by immensely superior forces,
during the last days of its march; since Valencia, the enemy’s base and
headquarters, where he would naturally concentrate, lies quite close to
the concluding stages of the route Teruel-Murviedro. It must have been
in sheer contempt for his opponent—a contempt which turned out to be
justified—that the Marshal sent a detachment of eleven battalions by
this road, for such a force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p.
9]</span> 5,000 men might have been beset by the whole Valencian army,
30,000 strong, and the other columns could not have helped it.</p>

<p>Suchet’s arrangements were governed by a single fact—his siege
artillery and heavy stores were parked at Tortosa, and from thence,
therefore, along the coast road, must be his main line of advance,
though it would be necessary to mask Peniscola and to capture Oropesa,
before he could get forward to his objective—the city of Valencia.
It might have seemed rational to move the whole field army by this
route: but some of the troops destined for it were coming from distant
points, and to march them down the Ebro bank to Tortosa would have
taken much time. Moreover if the whole force concentrated there, it
would all have to be fed from the magazines at Tortosa, and those lying
in Aragon would be of no use. The Marshal started himself from this
point, on September 15, with the division of Habert, and an infantry
reserve formed of Robert’s brigade of the division of Musnier, together
with the whole of the cavalry and field artillery of the army. The
siege-train guarded by the other brigade of Musnier’s division—that
of Ficatier—followed: but Musnier himself did not accompany the
expedition, having been left in general charge of the detachments
placed in garrison on the Ebro and in Upper Aragon. The whole column
made up about 11,000 combatants.</p>

<p>The second column, consisting of the two auxiliary
divisions—Palombini’s eleven Italian battalions and Compère’s 1,500
Neapolitans—took (without any artillery to hamper them) the mountain
road by Alcañiz and Morella: they were slightly over 7,000 strong, and,
if all went well, were destined to unite with the main body somewhere
near Oropesa or Castellon de la Plana. It was not likely that this
column would meet with much opposition.</p>

<p>But the third detachment, Harispe’s 5,000 men from Upper Aragon, who
were to take the inland and western road by Teruel, were essaying a
very dangerous task, if the enemy should prove active and enterprising,
more especially as they had no artillery and hardly any cavalry
with them. Blake might have taken the offensive with 20,000 men
against them, while still leaving something to contain—or at least to
observe—Suchet’s main column.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>The Spanish
Commander-in-Chief, however, did nothing of the sort, and met the
invasion with a tame and spiritless defensive on all its points. When
Suchet’s advance was reported, Blake had his forces in a very scattered
situation. Of the 36,000 men of whom he could nominally dispose, the
Empecinado’s ‘flying column’ was as usual detached in the mountains
of Molina and Guadalajara, harassing small French garrisons. Zayas’s
division had been left far to the south at Villena, near Alicante, to
work off the contagion of yellow fever which it had contracted while
passing by Cartagena. For in that port the disease was raging terribly
at the time. Obispo’s division was in the high hills on the borders
of Aragon. In the neighbourhood of Valencia were only the troops of
Lardizabal and Miranda, with the main body of the cavalry. The Army
of Murcia, which was destined to send succour if it should not find
itself beset by Soult on the other side, was lying cantoned at various
points in that province. As the French were at this time making no
demonstration from the side of Granada, it now became clear that it
would be able to send certain succours to Blake. But they were not yet
designated for marching, much less assembled, and it was clear that
they would come up very late.</p>

<p>This dispersion of the available troops did not, in the end, make
much difference to the fate of the campaign, for Blake had from the
first made up his mind to accept the defensive, to draw in his outlying
detachments, and to stand at bay in the neighbourhood of Valencia,
without attempting to make any serious resistance on the frontier.
Since his arrival he had been urging on the construction of a line of
earthworks, forming fortified camps, around the provincial capital.
The ancient walls of Valencia itself were incapable of any serious
resistance to modern artillery, but outside them, all along the banks
of the Guadalaviar river, for some miles inland to the West, and as
far as the sea on the East, batteries, <i>têtes-de-pont</i>, trenches, and
even closed works of considerable size had been constructed. It was by
holding them in force and with great numbers that Blake intended to
check the invasion. In front of his chosen position, at a distance of
twenty miles, there was a great advanced work—a newly restored fortress
of crucial importance—the fastness of Saguntum, or ‘San Fernando de
Sagunto’ as it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>
just been re-christened. This was the acropolis of one of the most
ancient towns of Spain, the Saguntum which had detained Hannibal so
long before its walls at the opening of the Third Punic War. In the age
of the Iberians, the Carthaginians, and the Romans, and even down to
the days of the Ommeyad califs, there had been a large and flourishing
city on this site. But in the later middle ages Saguntum had declined
in prosperity and population, and the modern town—which had changed its
name to Murviedro (<i>muri veteres</i>) had shrunk down to the foot of the
hill. It was now a small open place of 6,000 souls, quite indefensible.
But above it towered the steep line of rock which had formed the
citadel in ancient days: its narrow summit was crowned with many ruins
of various ages—from cyclopean foundations of walls, going back to the
time of the ancient Iberians, to Moorish watch-towers and palaces. The
empty space of steep slope, from the acropolis down to the modern town,
was also sprinkled with decaying walls and substructures of all sorts,
among which were cisterns and broken roadways, besides the remains of a
large Roman theatre, partly hewn out of the live rock.</p>

<p>There had been no fortifications by Murviedro when Suchet
last passed near Valencia, in his abortive raid of March 1810<a
id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. On that
occasion he had scaled the citadel to enjoy the view and to take a
casual survey of the picturesque ruins upon it<a id="FNanchor_8"
href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. But since then a
great change had taken place. On the advice, as it is said, of the
English general, Charles Doyle<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, Blake had determined to restore the citadel
as a place of strength. This was when he last held command in Valencia,
and before he joined the Cadiz Regency. But his idea had been carried
out after his departure by the Valencian Junta and the successive
Captains-General who had come after him. By means of more than a
year’s work the citadel had been made a tenable fortress, though one
of an irregular and unscientific sort. The old Iberian and Moorish
walls had been repaired and run together in a new <i>enceinte</i>, with
material taken from the other ruins all around. In especial the Roman
theatre, hitherto one of the most perfect in Southern Europe, had been
completely gutted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>
and its big blocks had proved most useful for building the foundations
of weak points of the circuit of fortification. This was strong at
some points, from the toughness and height of the old ramparts, but
very sketchy at others. Where the slope was absolutely precipitous, a
rough wall of dry stone without mortar alone had been carried along
the edge of the cliff. The narrow summit of the rock formed a most
irregular enclosure, varying much in height from one point to another.
It was divided into four separate sections cut off from each other
by cross-walls. The westernmost and lowest, facing the only point
from which there is a comparatively gentle ascent to the summit, was
crowned by a new battery called by the name of <i>Dos de Mayo</i>, to
commemorate the Madrid Insurrection of 1808. Rising high in the centre
of this work was an ancient bastion named the Tower of San Pedro. Much
higher, on the extreme peak of the summit, was the citadel tower,
called San Fernando, where the governor’s flag flew, and from whence
the whole fortress could be best surveyed. From this point the rock
descended rapidly, and its long irregular eastern crest was surrounded
by weakly-repaired walls, ending in two batteries called by the
names of Menacho, the gallant governor of Badajoz<a id="FNanchor_10"
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and Doyle, the English
general who had suggested the fortification of the place. But the
greater part of this eastern end of the works lay above slopes so
precipitous that it seemed unlikely that they would ever be attacked.
The western end, by the Dos Mayo battery, was the obvious point of
assault by an enemy who intended to use regular methods.</p>

<p>The construction was by no means finished when Suchet’s expedition
began: many parts of the new walls were only carried up to half their
intended height, and no regular shelter for the garrison had been
contrived. Instead of proper barracks and casemates there were only
rough ‘leans-to,’ contrived against old walls, or cover made by roofing
in with beams old broken towers, and bastions. The hospital was the
only spacious and regular building in the whole <i>enceinte</i>: the powder
magazine was placed deep down in the cellars of the fort San Fernando.
The armament of the place was by no means complete: the guns were being
sent up just as Suchet started. Only seventeen<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span> were ready, and of these no more than three
were 12-pounders: the rest were only of the calibre of field artillery
(4- and 8-pounders) or howitzers. A fortress which has only seventeen
guns for an <i>enceinte</i> of 3,000 yards, and possesses no heavy guns to
reply to the 18- or 24-pounders of a siege-train, is in a state of
desperate danger.</p>

<p>Blake had thrown into the place a brigade under the command of
Colonel Luis Andriani, consisting of five battalions, two each of
the regiments of Savoya and Don Carlos, one of the Cazadores de
Orihuela. Of these two were new ‘third battalions<a id="FNanchor_11"
href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>’ from the recently raised
‘Division of Reserve,’ incomplete in officers, only half drilled, and
not yet fully provided with uniforms. The total force came to 2,663
officers and men, including about 150 artillerymen and sappers. It is
probable that these troops would have made no better show in the open
field than did the rest of the Valencian army, a few weeks later: but
they showed behind walls the same capacity for unexpected resistance
which had surprised the French on other occasions at Ciudad Rodrigo,
Gerona, and Figueras. Andriani, the governor, seems to have made
an honourable attempt to do his duty at the head of the doubtfully
efficient garrison placed at his disposal.</p>

<p>In addition to Saguntum Blake held two outlying posts in his front,
Peniscola on its lofty headland, garrisoned by about 1,000 men under
General Garcia Navarro, and the half-ruined Oropesa, which he had
resolved to hold, because it blocked the sea-coast road so effectively.
But its only tenable points were two mediaeval towers, one in the town
commanding the high-road, the other by the shore of the Mediterranean.
Their joint garrisons did not amount to 500 men, and it was obvious
that they could not hold out many days against modern artillery. But
the gain of a day or two might conceivably be very valuable in the
campaign that was about to begin. It is clear, however, that his main
hope of resistance lay in the line of entrenched camps and batteries
along the Guadalaviar, in front of Valencia: here he intended to
make his real stand, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p.
14]</span> hoped that Saguntum, so little distant from this line, would
prove a serious hindrance to the enemy when he came up against it.</p>

<p>Suchet’s three columns all started, as Napoleon had ordered, on
September 15th. The Marshal’s own main body, coming from Tortosa,
reached Benicarlo, the first town across the Valencian frontier, next
day, and on the 17th came level with Peniscola, whose garrison kept
quiet within the limits of its isthmus. The Marshal left a battalion
and a few hussars to observe it, and to see that it did not make
sallies against his line of communication. On the 19th the head of
the marching column reached Torreblanca, quite close to Oropesa. A
reconnaissance found that the place was held, and came into contact
with some Spanish horse, who were easily driven off. This was the first
touch with Blake’s field army that had been obtained. But the enemy was
evidently not in force, and the garrison of Oropesa hastily retired
into the two towers which formed its only tenable positions. On a close
inspection it was found that the tower in the town completely commanded
the high-road, wherefore the Marshal took a slight circuit by suburban
lanes round the place, with his main body and guns, and continued his
advance, after leaving a few companies to blockade the towers. On
the same evening he was joined by Palombini’s column from Morella,
consisting of the two Italian divisions. They had accomplished their
march without meeting any resistance, though the road from Morella by
San Matteo and Cabanes was rough and easily defensible. The united
force, now 16,000 strong, proceeded on its march next day, and the
Marshal was agreeably surprised when, on the morning of the 20th, the
cavalry scouts on his right flank announced to him that they had come
in touch with Harispe’s column from Teruel, which had appeared at the
village of Villafanes a few miles from the main road. Thus the whole
army of invasion was happily united.</p>

<p>Harispe, as it turned out, had left Teruel on the 15th, in obedience
to his orders, by the post-road to Segorbe and the coast. But hearing
on the second day that a large Valencian force was holding the defile
of Las Barracas, where the road crosses the watershed, he had turned
off by a bad side-path to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p.
15]</span> Ruvielos in the upper valley of the Mijares, in the hope of
joining his chief without being forced to storm a difficult position.
Blake, as a matter of fact, much alarmed at the approach of a flanking
column on the Teruel side, and ignorant of its strength, had sent the
division of Obispo and some other detachments to hold the pass. But
no enemy came this way—Harispe had diverged down the course of the
Villahermosa river, by a country road only practicable for a force
without guns or wheeled transport, and got down by rapid marches to
the coast-plain beyond Alcora, without having seen any enemy save some
scattered guerrillero bands. He had thoroughly distracted Blake’s
attention and had run no danger, because he took an unexpected and
difficult route, in a direction quite different from that by which the
Spaniards expected him to appear<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>The whole army was now concentrated near Villafanes on September
21, save the detachments left to block Peniscola and Oropesa, and the
brigade of Ficatier, which, escorting the siege-train, had been left
at Tortosa, to await orders for starting when there should be no enemy
left in northern Valencia to molest it. The heavy guns were to come
forward down the coast-road, first to breach the towers of Oropesa, and
when the way past them was clear, to play their part, if necessary, in
the more serious task of battering Saguntum.</p>

<p>On advancing from Castellon de la Plana on September 22 the French
army found a very small Spanish rearguard—500 or 600 men—covering the
bridge of Villareal over the Mijares. They gave way before the first
attack, which was a very simple affair, since the river was nearly dry
and everywhere fordable. No more was seen of the enemy next day, and
on the 23rd Suchet found himself on the banks of the Palancia stream,
which flows under the foot of the rock of Saguntum. The Spaniards
had retired still further towards Valencia, leaving the fortress to
its own resources. These were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p.
16]</span> unknown to Suchet, who was aware that the ruinous citadel
had been rebuilt, but could not tell without further reconnaissance
what was its strength. In order to invest the place, and to make closer
investigation possible, Harispe’s division crossed the Palancia to the
right of Saguntum, Habert’s to the left. The latter sent six companies
into the town of Murviedro, and drove up some Spanish pickets from it
into the fortress which towered above. The two divisions then joined
hands to the south of Saguntum, completing its investment, while
Palombini’s Italians took post at Petres and Gillet on the road to
Segorbe—to the north-west—in case Blake might have placed some of his
troops on this side-route, with the object of troubling the siege by
attacks from the rear. The cavalry went forward down the high-road to
Valencia, and sent back news that they had explored as far as Albalete,
only six miles from the capital, and had met no enemy. The division of
Lardizabal and the cavalry of San Juan, which had been the observing
force in front of Suchet, had retired beyond the Guadalaviar river, and
had shut themselves up (along with the rest of Blake’s army) in the
entrenchments behind that stream. The Spanish general was evidently
acting on the strictest principles of passive defence.</p>

<p>The French marshal determined not to seek his enemy on his chosen
ground, till he should have taken Saguntum and brought up his
siege-train to the front. The former condition he thought would not
prove difficult to accomplish. A survey of the fortress revealed its
extremely irregular and incomplete state of defence. Though the cliffs
were in all parts steep and in some places inaccessible, many sections
of the works above them were obviously unfinished and very weak. After
a close reconnaissance by his engineer officers had been made, Suchet
determined that it would be worth while to try an attempt at escalade
on some of the most defective points, without waiting for the arrival
of the siege-train. He set his sappers and carpenters to work to make
sixty ladders, which were ready in full number on the third day.
The front chosen for the assault was in the <i>enceinte</i> immediately
overhanging the town of Murviedro, where two ancient gaps in the wall
were clearly visible; the new work was not half finished, and a low
structure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> roughly
completed with beams laid above the regular foundations, was all that
blocked the openings. The masons of the garrison were heard at night,
working hard to raise the height of the stone wall which was to replace
the temporary wooden parapets. There being no artillery available, they
could not be hindered in their building: but it did not seem to advance
very rapidly.</p>

<p>Suchet set apart for the actual escalade two columns, each composed
of 300 volunteers from Habert’s division: they were to be supported by
a reserve of similar strength under Colonel Gudin, which was formed up,
completely under cover, within the streets of Murviedro. At midnight
on September 27th-28th the stormers pushed forward under cover of the
darkness, and in small successive parties, into a large Roman cistern
above the ruined theatre, which was ‘dead ground,’ and not exposed to
fire from any part of the ramparts. Here they were only 120 yards from
the two breaches. Meanwhile, as a diversion, six Italian companies from
Palombini’s division were ordered to make a noisy demonstration against
the distant part of the defences which lay under the tower of San
Pedro<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
General Habert was to have 2,000 men more under arms, ready to support
the assailing column.</p>

<p>The stormers reached their appointed place apparently undiscovered,
and the attack would have been delivered—according to Suchet’s
dispatch—without any preliminary firing, but for an accident. The
Marshal says that the Spaniards had pushed an exploring patrol down the
hillside, which fell in with the French pickets and drew their fire.
Thereupon the assaulting columns in the cistern, thinking themselves
discovered, let off a few shots and charged uphill, a little ahead of
the appointed time, and before the Italian demonstration had begun<a
id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. The
governor, Andriani, in his dispatch, makes no mention of this, but
merely says that about 2 a.m. his sentinels thought that they detected
movements on the slopes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p.
18]</span> that a short time afterwards a fierce attack was delivered.
At any rate the garrison was not surprised as Suchet had hoped.</p>

<p>Owing to the lowness, however, of the walls blocking the two old
breaches, the assailants had, in their first rush, a fair chance of
breaking in. Many ladders were successfully planted, and repeatedly
small parties of the French got a footing on the wooden parapets. If
the garrison had flinched, the storm might have succeeded: but far
from flinching, they offered a desperate resistance, overthrew the
ladders, slew all who had gained the top of the <i>enceinte</i>, and kept
up a furious musketry fire, which laid low many of the soldiers who
kept pressing forward to the breaches. It was to no purpose that the
demonstration by the Italians below San Pedro now began: the Spaniards
fired hard and fast in this direction also, but did not withdraw any
men from the real point of attack, where they maintained themselves
very courageously. It was in vain that Colonel Gudin brought up his
reserve: it could make no head, and the survivors threw themselves down
among the rocks and ruins in front of the wall—unwilling to recede,
but quite unable to advance. Seeing his attack a hopeless failure,
Suchet ordered the stormers back just before daylight began to appear.
They had lost 247 killed and wounded out of 900 men engaged: the
garrison only 15 killed and less than 30 wounded<a id="FNanchor_15"
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>The escalade having come to this disappointing conclusion, the
Marshal saw that the siege of Saguntum would be anything but a quick
business. It would be necessary to bring up the siege-train to the
front: orders were sent back to Ficatier to start it at once from
Tortosa; but it had to batter and take Oropesa before it could even
reach Murviedro. There were some weeks of delay before him, and
meanwhile Blake might at last begin to show some signs of life. Suchet
therefore disposed his army so as to provide both a blockading force
and a covering force, to see that the blockade was not interfered with
from without. It being evident that many days would elapse before<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> the siege artillery
arrived, the French engineer officers got leave to employ many
detachments in preparing roads fit to bear heavy guns up the western
slopes of the hill of Saguntum, from which alone the regular attack on
the fortress could be conducted. Several emplacements for batteries
were also chosen, and work upon them was begun.</p>

<p>From September 23rd, the day of Suchet’s arrival before Saguntum,
down to October 16, when the heavy guns at last arrived, the French
army was practically ‘marking time’: the idea which the Emperor had
conceived, and which his lieutenant had adopted, that Valencia could be
conquered by a sudden rush, had been proved false. Apparently Suchet
had gained no more by his rapid advance to the foot of the hill of
Saguntum than he would have obtained by marching in more leisurely
fashion, with his siege artillery in company, and taking Oropesa on the
way. The reduction of that place indeed was (as it turned out) only a
single day’s task for heavy guns: and if the Marshal had captured it
on his march, he might have presented himself before Saguntum with his
siege-train, and have begun an active attack on that fortress, some
weeks before he was actually able to get to serious work. In fact he
might have been battering Saguntum on October 1, instead of having to
wait till October 16th. But this is ‘wisdom after the event’: Napoleon
thought that Valencia could be ‘rushed,’ and Suchet was bound to make
the experiment that his master ordered.</p>

<p>Blake meanwhile, finding, on September 23rd, that the enemy was not
about to advance against his lines, and learning soon after that the
French army had settled down before Saguntum, had to revise his plans,
since it was clear that he was not to be attacked in his entrenchments
as he had supposed. Three courses were now open to him: either he might
collect every man for a decisive battle in the open, and try to raise
the siege; or he might attempt to open up attacks on Suchet’s line of
communications and on his base in Aragon, so as to force him to retire
by indirect operations; or he might remain passive behind the lines
of the Guadalaviar. The last was an almost unthinkable alternative—it
would have ruined his reputation for ever to sit quiet and do nothing,
as Wellington had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p.
20]</span> during the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1810. Only a general
with an established reputation for courage and ability could have
dared to take such a course; and Blake’s record was a long series of
disasters, while he was detested by the Valencians one and all—by the
army, to whom he rightly preferred his own excellent troops, no less
than by the Captain-General Palacios, and the Junta, whom he had sent
out of the city to sit at Alcira, when they showed a tendency to hamper
his operations. Practically he was forced by his situation to take some
definite offensive move against Suchet.</p>

<p>He chose that of indirect operations, having a well-rooted distrust
of the fighting powers of a great part of the troops that were at
his disposition. The record of the Valencian army he knew: the state
of the Murcian army, on which he could draw for reinforcements, was
represented to him in the most gloomy colours by Mahy, who had recently
replaced Freire in command. On September 12th Mahy had written to him,
to warn him that the spirit of his troops was detestable: ‘the Army of
Murcia was little better than a phantom: there were only four or five
officers for whom the rank and file had any respect or esteem, the
rest were regarded as timid or incapable: the men had no confidence
in themselves or their chiefs. The best thing to do would be to
break up the whole army, and incorporate it into the “Expeditionary
Divisions,” whose commanders were known as good soldiers, and whose
battalions were trustworthy<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.’</p>

<p>In view of these facts Blake resolved to threaten Suchet’s flanks
with demonstrations, which he had no intention of turning into
attacks, but to endeavour to dislodge him from his forward position
by turning loose the guerrilleros of Aragon on to his rear. With the
former purpose he sent out two detachments from the Valencian lines,
Obispo’s division to Segorbe,—where it cut the French communication
with Teruel and southern Aragon,—Charles O’Donnell with Villacampa’s
infantry and San Juan’s horse to Benaguacil, a point in the plains
fifteen miles west of Saguntum, where his force formed a link between
Obispo and the main body of the Valencian army,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> which still remained entrenched in the
lines of the Guadalaviar<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. These two detachments threatened Suchet’s
flank, and even his rear, but there was no intention of turning the
threat into a reality.</p>

<p>The real movement on which Blake relied for the discomfiture of
the invaders of Valencia was that of the guerrillero bands of Aragon
and the neighbouring parts of Castile, to whom he had appealed for
help the moment that Suchet commenced his march. He believed that the
6,000 or 7,000 men which Suchet had left scattered in small garrisons
under General Musnier might be so beset and worried by the <i>partidas</i>,
that the Marshal might be compelled to turn back to their aid. Even
Mina from his distant haunts in Navarre had been asked to co-operate.
This was an excellent move, and might have succeeded, if Musnier alone
had remained to hold down Aragon. But Blake had forgotten in his
calculations the 15,000 men of Reille and Severoli, cantoned in Navarre
and along the Upper Ebro, who were available to strengthen the small
force which lay in the garrisons under Musnier’s charge.</p>

<p>The diversion of the guerrilleros, however, was effected with
considerable energy. On September 26th the Empecinado and Duran
appeared in front of Calatayud, the most important of the French
garrisons in the mountains of western Aragon. They had with them 5,000
foot and 500 horse—not their full strength, for a large band of the
Empecinado’s men beset at the same time the remote castle of Molina,
the most outlying and isolated of all Suchet’s posts. Calatayud was
held by a few companies of French, to which an Italian flying column of
a battalion had just joined itself. The guerrilleros, coming in with a
rush, drove the garrison out of the town into their fortified post, the
large convent of La Merced, taking many prisoners in the streets. Duran
then beleaguered the main body in the convent, while the Empecinado
took post at the defile of El Frasno on the Saragossa road, to hold off
any succour that Musnier might send up from the Aragonese capital. This
precaution was justified—a column of 1,000 men came out of Saragossa,
but was far too weak to force the pass and had to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span> retire, with the loss of its commander,
Colonel Gillot, and many men. Meanwhile Duran pressed the besieged in
the convent with mines, having no artillery of sufficient calibre to
batter its walls. After blowing down a corner of its chapel with one
mine, and killing many of the defenders, the guerrillero chief exploded
a second on October 3, which made such a vast breach that the garrison
surrendered, still 560 strong, on the following day<a id="FNanchor_18"
href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>This success would have gone far to shake the hold of the French
on Aragon, but for the intervention of Reille from Navarre. At the
first news of the blockade of Calatayud, he had dispatched a column,
consisting of the whole brigade of Bourke, 3,500 strong, which would
have saved the garrison if it had had a less distance to march. But it
arrived on the 5th to find the convent blown up, while the Spaniards
had vanished with their prisoners. Bourke thereupon returned to Tudela,
and the guerrilleros reoccupied Calatayud on his departure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the whole Italian division of Severoli, over
7,000 strong, marched down the Ebro to reinforce the small garrison
of Saragossa. This large reinforcement restored the confidence of
the French. Musnier himself took charge of it and marched at its
head against Duran and the Empecinado. They wisely refused to fight,
gave way, evacuated Calatayud, and took refuge in the hills (October
12). While the main field-force of the enemy was drawn off in this
direction, Mina took up the game on the other side of the Ebro.
Entering Aragon with 4,000 men he besieged the small garrison of Exea,
which abandoned its post, and cut its way through the guerrilleros,
till it met a column of 800 Italian infantry<a id="FNanchor_19"
href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> sent out from Saragossa
to bring it off. Colonel Ceccopieri, the leader of this small force,
underrating the strength of his enemy, then marched to relieve the
garrison of Ayerbe. He was surprised on the way by Mina’s whole force,
and in a long running fight between Ayerbe and Huesca was surrounded
and slain. The column was exterminated, two hundred Italians were
killed, six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> hundred
(including many wounded) were taken prisoners (October 16th).</p>

<p>Musnier returned in haste from Calatayud at the news of this
disaster, but left the bulk of Severoli’s division to occupy western
Aragon. He then set himself, with the help of Reille, to hunt down
Mina. But the latter, marching with ease between the columns that
pursued him, for the peasantry kept him informed day by day of every
movement of the enemy, retreated westward. Easily eluding the French,
he made an extraordinary excursion, right across Navarre, Alava, and
Biscay, down to the sea coast at Motrico, where he handed over his
prisoners to the captain of the British frigate <i>Isis</i>, and then
returned unharmed to his familiar haunts. Of such a delusive nature
was the hold of the French on Northern Spain, that a column of 5,000
men could march for 200 miles across it without being intercepted or
destroyed.</p>

<p>All these exploits of the guerrilleros were daring and well planned,
but though they had given Musnier much trouble, and cost the French
many a weary hour of march and countermarch, they had not cleared
Aragon of the enemy, nor shaken Suchet’s position. Indeed, on October
20, the general condition of affairs in Aragon was more favourable for
the invaders than on September 20, for two fresh divisions had been
drawn down into that province, and there were 20,000 French and Italian
troops in it instead of 6,000. The petty disasters at Calatayud and
Ayerbe were irritating rather than important. Suchet never for a moment
felt inclined to relax his hold upon Valencia: that western Aragon was
in an uproar affected him little, when his communication with his two
main dépôts of stores at Tortosa and Morella was not interrupted.</p>

<p>Blake, it may be mentioned, did not content himself with setting
the Empecinado and Duran in motion, he tried another division in
another quarter with even less result. Rumours had reached him that
King Joseph’s Army of the Centre was about to co-operate with Suchet,
by sending a column across the mountains to Cuenca and Requeña. The
news was false, for though Napoleon had ordered the King to do what he
could to help in the invasion of Valencia, Joseph had replied that he
had not even one brigade to spare for a serious demonstration,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span> and had not moved—the
guerrilleros gave sufficient occupation to his much-scattered army,
of which a large portion was composed of untrustworthy Spanish
<i>Juramentados</i>. But, listening to vain reports, Blake ordered Mahy to
collect the best of his Murcian troops and to march on Cuenca to meet
the supposed invaders. His subordinate, leaving Freire in command in
Murcia, took seven selected battalions of foot under Creagh and the
Marquis of Montijo, with 800 horse and one battery, and moved from his
camp at Mula by Hellin and Chinchilla northward. The distance to be
covered was great, the roads after Chinchilla very bad. Mahy arrived
in front of Cuenca on October 15th, to find that there was only one
battalion and two squadrons of Joseph’s army there. This little force
evacuated the high-lying city in haste, and fled towards Madrid the
moment that the Murcians showed themselves. No other French force
could be heard of in any direction. At Cuenca Mahy received a dispatch
from Blake (who had apparently discovered his mistake about the Army
of the Centre), telling him to descend from the mountains by Moya and
Liria, and to join the wing of the main army, which lay under Obispo at
Segorbe. It was only on the 23rd October that he came in: his troops,
the pick of the Murcian army, had been completely wasted for some
twenty days in a circular march against a non-existent enemy. Meanwhile
every man had been wanted in Valencia.</p>

<p>Suchet, when once he had settled down to the siege of Saguntum,
had not failed to notice Blake’s weak demonstration against his flank
by means of the divisions of Obispo and Charles O’Donnell. He did not
intend to tolerate it, and on September 30 had sent Palombini with his
own Italian division and Robert’s French brigade to beat up Obispo’s
quarters at Segorbe. The Spanish division made a poor attempt to defend
itself on a position in front of that town, but was easily beaten and
retired into the mountains. It was then the turn of Charles O’Donnell;
when Palombini had come back to the camp, Suchet took Harispe’s
division, with Robert’s brigade, and two regiments of cavalry, to evict
the Spanish division from Benaguacil. O’Donnell made a slightly better
fight than Obispo had done, and deployed Villacampa’s infantry behind
an irrigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span> canal,
with San Juan’s cavalry on his flanks. But the French were superior in
numbers as well as in confidence: one fierce charge broke O’Donnell’s
line, and he had to retreat in haste to the hills behind him, losing
400 men, cut up in the pursuit by Suchet’s cavalry, while the French
casualties barely reached three officers and sixty men (October 2nd).
Blake, who had been quite close enough to succour O’Donnell if he had
chosen, made no attempt to aid him, and kept quiet behind his lines on
the Guadalaviar. There the routed troops joined him next day.</p>

<p>Suchet, having thus cleared his flanks, settled down to the siege
of Saguntum, where his heavy artillery was now much needed. The
besieging army had to content itself for another fortnight with making
preparations for the expected train—levelling roads and constructing
approaches on the ground which was destined for the front of attack, at
the west end of the hill of Saguntum.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the siege-train was lumbering down from Tortosa by the
coast-road. On October 6th Suchet started to meet it, taking with him
the 1,500 Neapolitans of Compère. On the 8th he reached Oropesa, where
he found the small Spanish garrison still holding the two towers which
have before been mentioned. The first guns that came up were turned
against the tower by the high-road; it was easily breached, and on
the 10th surrendered: 215 men and four guns were captured. Next day
came the turn of the other tower, that by the sea; but before the
siege-battery had opened on it, the British 74 <i>Magnificent</i> and a
squadron of Spanish gunboats ran inshore, and took off the garrison of
150 men in their boats, under the ineffective fire of the French.</p>

<p>The moment that the tower which blocked the high-road had fallen,
and before that on the shore had been evacuated, Suchet began to
push the head of his precious convoy of heavy artillery southward.
It made such a good pace that the first guns arrived at the camp
before Saguntum as early as the night of October 12th. Meanwhile the
Marshal himself returned thither, escorted by Compère’s Neapolitans:
the brigade of Ficatier, which had escorted the train hitherto, was
dispersed to cover the line of communications, placing its five
battalions at Oropesa, Almenara, and Segorbe.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER II">SECTION XXX: CHAPTER II</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE BATTLE OF SAGUNTUM. OCTOBER 1811</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Charles O’Donnell and Obispo
had been driven away from the threatening position upon Suchet’s
flank, Blake found himself during the early days of October in a very
unpleasant dilemma. It was clear that his own feeble efforts to molest
the French army were a complete failure. Presently the message reached
him that Mahy’s unlucky expedition to Cuenca had been absolutely
useless. But the most disheartening news was that the attempt to
overrun Aragon by means of the guerrilleros had failed; its initial
success, the capture of Calatayud on October 3, had only led to the
inundation of the whole countryside in that direction by the numerous
battalions of Reille and Severoli.</p>

<p>As the days wore on, Blake found himself obliged to confess that
the idea of dislodging Suchet by operations in his rear was hopeless.
The only remaining alternative for him was to endeavour to call
together every available man, and to try to beat the French army in
a great pitched battle. Considering the well-known disrepute of both
the Murcian and the Valencian troops, the prospect was not one that
the Spanish general could view with much confidence. But political
reasons forced him to fight—his policy of passive resistance had made
him so unpopular with the Valencians of all ranks, from the members
of the exiled Junta down to the private soldiers, that if he had held
back any longer it is probable that he might have been deposed or
murdered by a conspiracy. Saguntum was holding out most gallantly, and
the ignominy of leaving it to fall, without making any effort for its
succour, was sufficiently evident. He made up his mind about the middle
of October that he must advance and fight. But, being very properly
determined to fight with all available resources, he had to await the
descent of Mahy and the Murcians from Cuenca, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> by his own fault that important column
could not be drawn in to the main army before the 23rd. It was only on
that day that an advance in force became possible: for a week and more
Blake anxiously awaited the junction, and until it took place he would
not move.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Suchet, entirely unmolested, was pressing the siege of
Saguntum with all possible expedition. The first siege-guns from
Tortosa reached his camp, as has been already mentioned, on October
12th. But it was not till four days later that the actual battering of
the place began. Though paths had been traced out, and the emplacements
of batteries settled, long ere the siege-train came up, the actual
getting of the guns into position proved a very tiresome business,
on account of the steep and rocky slopes over which they had to be
dragged. And the construction of approaches and parallels upon the
hillside progressed very slowly, because of the absence of earth—at
last it was found that soil to bind the loose stones of the ground
together would have, for the most part, to be carried up in sandbags
from the valley below, for hardly any could be scraped together on the
spot. The engineer officer who wrote the diary of the siege confesses
that if the Spanish garrison had only been provided with heavy
artillery, the approach-building would have proved almost impossible<a
id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. But, as
has been already noted, there were but seventeen guns mounted in the
whole fortress, and of these only three were 12-pounders—the rest being
small field-pieces, too weak to batter down parapets of even modest
thickness. Moreover the very steepness of the slope over which the
siege-works were being advanced made much of it ‘dead ground,’ which
guns above could not properly sweep or search out.</p>

<p>On the 11th of October the two generals, Vallée and Rogniat, who
had regularly commanded Suchet’s artillery and engineers during
his previous sieges, arrived from the rear—both had been in France
on leave, and they had come forward with the train from Tortosa to
Oropesa. Their arrival added confidence to the subordinates who
had hitherto worked without them, for the reputation of each for
success was very great. Rogniat immediately on his arrival made
several important modifica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p.
28]</span>tions in the projected batteries, and showed how the
approaches might be pushed forward to within seventy yards of the
fortress, by taking advantage of favourable dips and rocky outcrops in
the hillside.</p>

<p>On the 16th, five batteries were armed with the guns which had
come up, and fire was opened upon the projecting western angle of the
fortress, the tower of San Pedro. It proved to be made of ancient
Moorish stone and mortar, almost as hard as iron, and crumbled very
slowly. But the modern works below it, which were only a few months
old, owned no such resisting power, and within two days showed signs
of serious damage. The Spanish counter-fire was insignificant—there
were very few guns available, and it was only when the approaches got
within easy musket shot of the walls that the besiegers began to suffer
appreciable casualties. For the Spanish infantry, disregarding the
cannonade, kept up a furious fire against the heads of the saps all day
and night.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 18th the engineer and artillery officers
reported to Suchet that they had made a sufficient breach in the
curtain of the work called the Dos Mayo battery, just where it joined
on the tower of San Pedro, and that they regarded it as practicable
for assault. The Marshal ordered that the storm should be fixed for
the same evening, lest the Spaniards should succeed in repairing
the breach during the hours of darkness. The column of assault
consisted of 400 men, picked from Habert’s division, supported by
a reserve of Palombini’s Italians. The fire of the siege artillery
was kept up to the last moment, and did much harm to the garrison,
who were very clearly seen piling gabions, sandbags, and stones
on the ruinous lip of the breach, in disregard of the steady fire
that kept pounding it down<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21"
class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>The assault was duly delivered at five o’clock, and proved a
complete failure. The stormers found the breach most difficult to
climb, as its face was entirely formed of big blocks of stone without
earth or débris. The column won its way half up the ascent, and
isolated officers and men got further, and were bayoneted or shot at
close quarters by the defenders, who clustered very thickly at the
top. But no general rush of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p.
29]</span> could reach the summit, where (it is said) the actual gap in
the parapet was not more than six or seven feet broad. After several
ineffective attempts to mount, the assailants came to a stand on the
lower part of the slope, and opened a scattering fire on the Spaniards
above them. Whereupon, seeing the opportunity lost, General Habert, who
had been given charge of the operations, ordered the men to fall back
to the trenches, and to abandon the assault.</p>

<p>This was a most creditable feat of arms for the garrison, who had
hardly a cannon to help them, and held their own almost entirely by
musketry fire, though they rolled some live shells, beams, and large
stones down the breach at intervals. Their casualties were heavy, but
those of the assailants, as was natural, much greater. Suchet lost at
least 300 men, though in his dispatch to the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_22"
href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> he gave an elaborate
table of casualties showing a total of only 173. But his ‘returns,’
even the most specious looking of them, should never be trusted—as will
be seen when we are dealing with the second battle of Castalla in a
later volume. This excellent officer was as untrustworthy as Soult or
Masséna in the figures which he sent to his master<a id="FNanchor_23"
href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>After this Suchet resolved to make no more attempts to storm
Saguntum. ‘When even the best of soldiers,’ remarks Belmas, ‘have
made every effort to carry a place and have failed, they imagine that
the place is impregnable. And if an attempt is made to lead them
once more to an assault, they will not again act with the confidence
which is needed to secure victory.’ Wellington was to find this out
at Burgos, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span> year
later. Indeed in their early stages the sieges of Saguntum and Burgos
show a rather notable parallelism, though their ends were dissimilar.
General Rogniat easily persuaded the Marshal to drop the heroic method
which had gained so little success, and to fall back on the systematic
work which is slow but certain<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.’ Suchet gave permission to the engineers to
establish more batteries, and to defer all further attempts to storm
till the approaches should have been carried up to the very foot of the
walls, and the whole curtain of the Dos Mayo redoubt should have been
battered down.</p>

<p>The garrison, much encouraged by their successful effort of the
18th, continued to make an obstinate resistance: as the enemy sapped
uphill towards them, they kept up such a careful and deadly fire that
the casualties in the trenches amounted every day to 15 or 20 men. For
the next six days nothing decisive happened, though the works continued
to creep slowly forward: they had to be built with parapets consisting
entirely of earth brought from below, and made very high, since the
nearer they got to the works, the more did the plunging fire from above
search them out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Blake was preparing, though with no great self-confidence,
to make an attack on Suchet’s siege-lines, and was only awaiting the
arrival of Mahy and the Murcians before striking. He began by trying
a feeble diversion on the flank, sending back Obispo’s division once
more to Segorbe, and getting some of the Empecinado’s bands to threaten
Teruel, the southernmost of the garrisons in Aragon. This so far
annoyed the French marshal that on the 20th of October he sent off
Palombini, with one French and one Italian brigade and 400 horse, to
drive Obispo out of Segorbe, and to open the road to Teruel. By so
doing he placed himself in a dangerous position, for he had detached
4,500 men on an excursion which could not take less than four days,
and if Blake had refused to wait for Mahy, and had let Obispo amuse
Palombini, he could have marched against the siege-lines with 20,000
men, including all his best troops, and would have found only 12,000,
besides the gunners of the siege artillery, left in the French camp.
If Suchet had left any detachments to maintain the blockade, as he
probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> would have
done, he could only have fought with odds of less than one to two. If
he had brought up all his battalions, the garrison would have sallied
forth and destroyed his siege-works.</p>

<p>But Blake did not take his chance—whatever it may have been worth:
he waited for Mahy, who was only due on the 23rd. Meanwhile Palombini
made a rapid raid upon Segorbe: but Obispo, leaving two battalions
only to make a show of resistance, crossed the hills by by-paths and
drew in to Liria, on the flank of the main army, and in close touch
with it. He could have been used for a battle, if Blake had chosen to
deliver one upon the 22nd or 23rd. But the unlucky Spanish general did
not so choose: and Palombini—finding nothing serious in front of him,
and hearing that Teruel had been already relieved by Severoli—rightly
returned by forced marches to Saguntum, which he reached on the
afternoon of the 24th of October.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the long-expected Mahy arrived at Liria on the night
of the 23rd, and found Obispo already lying there. The two forces
united, and marched on the 24th to Betera, but there again divided,
the Murcians going on to join Blake’s main body, while the Valencian
division received orders from the Commander-in-Chief to move as an
independent flanking column, and from Naquera to fall upon the flank or
right rear of Suchet’s position in front of Saguntum.</p>

<p>On the same day Blake himself broke out of the lines behind the
Guadalaviar, and after issuing a well-worded proclamation, in which he
said that Andriani’s gallant garrison must not perish unassisted, and
declared a confidence which he must have been far from feeling in the
resolution of his troops, advanced for some miles along the high-road,
so as to place himself at nightfall within striking distance of the
enemy.</p>

<p>His plan of operations, which was clearly set forth in his
directions to Mahy<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, was ambitious in the highest degree, and
aimed at the complete destruction of his enemy. Expecting to find
Suchet drawn up to meet him in the plain south of Saguntum, it appears
that he intended to fight a battle in which an immensely strong left
wing was to turn and break down Suchet’s right, while a weaker right
wing (composed, however, of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p.
32]</span> best troops) was to attack him frontally, and hold his main
body ‘contained,’ while the turning movement was delivered. The left
wing contained 26 battalions and nearly 20 squadrons, making nearly
16,000 bayonets and 1,700 sabres<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The detached division of Obispo, from
Naquera, was to fall on the extreme French right from the rear; the
two other Valencian infantry divisions (Miranda and Villacampa), led
by Charles O’Donnell, were to tackle it in front. Mahy’s Murcians were
to support O’Donnell, at the same time reaching out a hand towards
Obispo—in order to do this Mahy was directed to send out two battalions
(under a Colonel O’Ronan) to Cabezbort, a hillside intermediate between
the point where Obispo was expected and the left of the two other
Valencian divisions. The left wing had allotted to it the whole of
the Murcian horse, 800 sabres, and one of the two Valencian cavalry
brigades, under General San Juan, which was of about the same strength.
It had also 18 guns.</p>

<p>So much for the left wing. The right wing, conducted by Blake in
person, which had advanced up the high-road from Valencia towards
Murviedro, consisted of the two ‘Expeditionary Divisions’ of Zayas
and Lardizabal, both very weak because of the losses which they
had suffered in the campaign around Baza in August—each was eight
battalions strong; but the former had only 2,500, the latter 3,000 men,
so that the units averaged well under 400 bayonets. But these were good
old troops, which had greatly distinguished themselves at Albuera: they
were the only part of Blake’s army in which any real confidence could
be placed. In support of these veterans the Commander-in-Chief brought
up the Valencian ‘Division of Reserve,’ which consisted entirely of the
newly raised 3rd battalions of the regiments serving with Villacampa
and Miranda. They had only been under arms a few months, were not fully
equipped or clothed, and were dreadfully under-officered; for five
strong battalions, of over 700 bayonets each,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span> there were only 75 officers in all—fifteen
per battalion, where there should have been thirty, and these were
the mere leavings of the older units of each regiment, or else newly
gazetted ensigns. As a fighting force these 3,500 men were nearly
useless—and Blake put them where they were least likely to get into
trouble. They were divided into two brigades: Brigadier-General Velasco
seems to have been in command, <i>vice</i> Acuña, who had the division
during the autumn. The right column was accompanied by the handful of
horse belonging to the ‘Expeditionary Force’—300 sabres under General
Loy—and by the second Valencian Cavalry Brigade under General Caro,
some 800 mounted men more. It was accompanied, like the other wing, by
three batteries. Thus, counting its gunners and sappers, the right wing
had under 10,500 men, while the immensely strong left had over 17,000.
But it is quality rather than mere numbers which counts in war—the
weak wing fought a good battle against equal strength, and looked for
a moment as if it might win. The strong wing disgraced itself, and was
routed by a fourth of its own numbers.</p>

<p>Suchet had been somewhat troubled by the first news of Blake’s
sudden sally from Valencia, for though he desired a battle, wherein
success would probably win him the immediate surrender of the
hard-pressed garrison of Saguntum, yet he did not wish that matters
should be forced to a crisis in Palombini’s absence. It was only after
the well-timed return of that general to his camp, that he welcomed the
approach of a decisive action. But with Palombini at his disposition
again, he was eager to fight.</p>

<p>He had at this moment with him, in the lines before Saguntum,
35 battalions of foot (of which the three Neapolitan units under
Compère were mere skeletons, with little over a thousand men between
them), with 15 squadrons of horse and 36 field-guns. He left behind
him, to maintain the siege-works before the fortress, two battalions
of the 117th line from Habert’s division, and Balathier’s Italian
brigade, making four battalions more. The weak Neapolitan brigade of
Compère, only 1,400 men, even with its cavalry included, was placed in
support of the blockading force, at Gillet and Petres, to watch the
road from Segorbe, by which some outlying Spanish detachment<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> might possibly attempt to
communicate with the garrison of Saguntum. This left for the line of
battle 26 battalions—six of Habert’s, eleven of Harispe’s, four of
Palombini’s Italians, and five of Robert’s reserve brigade. The total
amounted to about 12,000 infantry, while the whole of the cavalry,
except the two Neapolitan squadrons, was put in the field to the amount
of some 1,800 sabres. Counting the gunners of the six batteries of
artillery, Suchet’s fighting force was not much over 14,000 men. He had
left 4,000, besides the gunners of the siege-train and the sappers, to
deal with the garrison of Saguntum. This was little more than half of
Blake’s numbers, for the Spanish general—as we have seen—was marching
forward with 27,000 men in line. That Suchet gladly took the risk
sufficiently shows his opinion of the quality of the greater part of
the Valencian army. It seems, we must confess, rather hazardous to have
left 4,000 men in the blockading corps, when forces were so unequal. In
a similar case Beresford at Albuera took every man out of the trenches,
and fought with his whole army. Andriani’s garrison was not numerous
enough to execute any really dangerous sally in the rear, and was so
constricted, in its precipitous fastness, that it could not easily come
down or deploy itself. Perhaps Suchet may have feared, however, that it
would take the opportunity of absconding by some postern, if it were
not shut in upon all sides. But there were to be moments during the
battle when the Marshal would gladly have had the assistance of two or
three more battalions of steady troops.</p>

<p>Suchet had chosen for his fighting-ground the narrow plain south of
Saguntum, extending from the sea to the foot of the hills of the Sancti
Espiritus range—a space of less than three miles in very flat ground.
It was open for the most part, but sprinkled in certain sections with
olives and carob-trees, and contained one or two slight eminences or
mounds, which rose above the general surface, though only by a score
or two of feet, so that they had a certain command over the adjoining
flats. The left of the line, nearest to the sea, was formed of Habert’s
imperfect division, which, having detached two battalions for the
blockade of Saguntum, had only six left—2,500 bayonets—in line. The
right consisted of Harispe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p.
35]</span> division, which was stronger than Habert’s, as it had nine
battalions in line, even after setting aside one regiment (the 44th)
for a flank-guard. Its force was about 3,600 bayonets. This division
lay to the right of the road from Murviedro to Valencia. The reserve
consisted of the Italian brigade (that of Saint Paul), which had not
been told off for the siege, and of the three French cavalry regiments,
in all 2,000 bayonets and 1,300 sabres. It was drawn up half a mile
in rear of Habert and Harispe, ready to support either of them. The
batteries, horse and foot, accompanied their respective divisions.</p>

<p>We have thus accounted for 10,000 men. The remainder of Suchet’s
fighting force constituted a flank-guard, to prevent his line from
being turned on its right, the side of the hills. It originally
consisted of Robert’s ‘reserve brigade,’ five battalions, or 2,500
bayonets, and of one cavalry regiment, Schiazzetti’s Italian
dragoons—450 sabres—with one battery. These troops were drawn up on
the higher slopes of the Sancti Espiritus hills, covering the pass of
the same name and the country road which goes over it. To these Suchet
added, at the last moment, one regiment from Harispe’s division, the
44th, under the Brigadier Chlopiski, who, being senior to Robert,
took command of the whole flank-guard. These two battalions—1,200
men—took post on the hill-slopes to the left of Robert, half-way
between his position and that of Harispe’s right. The whole force,
including the dragoons and the artillery, made about 4,300 men.
Compère’s Neapolitans were too far to their left rear to be reckoned an
appreciable support, and had their own separate task, though they were
never called upon to discharge it. The ground occupied by Chlopiski’s
4,300 men was exceedingly strong, and the Marshal hoped that they might
be relied upon to hold off the turning movement, which he was aware
was to be made against his inland flank. For he knew that Charles
O’Donnell was advancing from the direction of Betera, which could
only mean a projected attack on his own right. Had he realized that
not only O’Donnell, but also Obispo and Mahy’s Murcians, in all some
17,000 men, were about to operate against Chlopiski, he must surely
have strengthened his covering force, for the odds would have been
impossible if the Valencians had made any fight at all. But they did
not!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>On the morning of
the 25th of October Suchet was ready to receive the attack which was
impending. He could make out the general dispositions of the enemy,
and the concentric advance of Obispo’s, O’Donnell’s, and Blake’s
own men was duly reported to him. It was on receiving notice of the
heavy appearance of the second, or central, hostile column that he
detached Chlopiski’s two battalions to strengthen Robert’s flank-guard.
Presently, about 7 o’clock, the Spaniards came within touch; the
left, it would seem, somewhat before the right<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, the first shots being
interchanged between the two battalions which Mahy had sent towards
Cabezbort and Robert’s troops. This was only a trifling skirmish, the
Spaniards being completely checked. But soon after a serious attack was
delivered.</p>

<p>The next advance was that of the two Valencian divisions under
Charles O’Donnell, who were a long way ahead of the main body of Mahy’s
Murcians, their destined reserve. Blake’s intention was apparently
to strike with his left wing first, and to force in the French right
before his own column delivered its blow. Everything depended on the
successful action of the mass of Valencian and Murcian infantry against
the small hostile force posted on the slopes of the Sancti Espiritus
hills.</p>

<p>The divisions of Miranda and Villacampa duly descended from the
lower opposite heights of the Germanels, crossed the bottom, and
began to mount the opposing slope, Villacampa on the left, somewhat
in advance, Miranda a little to his right<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> rear: behind them in support marched San
Juan’s Valencian cavalry. Beyond the latter there was a considerable
gap to the nearest troops of Blake’s own column, which had not yet
come into action. Mahy, whose orders definitely said that he was to
act as a reserve, and to protect O’Donnell’s flank if the latter were
checked, occupied the Germanels, when the Valencians had gone on, and
was still at the top of his own slope, having to his left front the
two detached battalions at Cabezbort under O’Ronan, when the clash
came. Waiting till the two Valencian divisions and the cavalry in
support were some little way up the hill, and had begun to drive in
his skirmishers, Chlopiski moved down upon them with the whole of his
modest force—Robert’s five battalions in front, to the right of the
pass and the road, his own two battalions of the 44th to its left and
somewhat on the flank. Meanwhile Schiazzetti’s regiment of Italian
dragoons charged down the gap between the two bodies of infantry. As
Villacampa was somewhat ahead of Miranda, the first crash fell upon
him. Robert’s infantry drove him without any difficulty right downhill,
while the Italian dragoons rode at Miranda’s battalions on his right.
Villacampa’s men fell into hopeless confusion, but what was worse was
that Miranda’s division, seeing their comrades break, gave way before
the cavalry without making any resistance whatever, apparently before
the French 44th had even got into touch with them on the flank. This
was a disgraceful business: the 7,000 Valencian infantry, and the
1,700 cavalry in support, were routed in ten minutes by half their own
numbers—one good cavalry regiment of 450 sabres sufficed to upset a
whole division of seven battalions—if a single one of them had formed
a steady square, the Italian horse ought to have been driven off with
ease!</p>

<p>But this was not the end of the affair. San Juan’s horse were
close behind the routed divisions—O’Donnell ordered them up to save
the wrecks of his infantry: at the same time Mahy hurried forward two
battalions of his Murcians<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to support San Juan, and began to advance
with the rest of his division down the slope of the Germanels hill.</p>

<p>After making havoc of the Valencian foot, Chlopiski had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> halted his troops for a
moment, wishing to be sure that matters were going well with the French
main body before he committed himself to any further enterprise. But
the temptation to go on was too great, for the routed Spanish troops
and their supports were weltering together in confusion at the bottom
of the hill. It is said that the dragoon colonel, Schiazzetti, settled
the matter for his superior, by charging at San Juan’s horse the moment
that he had got his squadrons re-formed. The Valencian cavalry, though
it outnumbered the Italians by two to one, turned tail at once and
bolted, riding over the two battalions of Murcian infantry which were
in its immediate rear, and carrying them away in its panic. Chlopiski
then led on his seven battalions against the disordered mass in front
of him, and swept the whole before him. It gave way and fled uphill,
horse and foot, the Murcian cavalry brigade in reserve going off on
the same panic-stricken way as the Valencian. It was some time before
Mahy could get a single regiment to stand—but at last he found a sort
of rearguard of two battalions (one of his own, one of Villacampa’s<a
id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>) which
had kept together and were still capable of obeying orders. The
French were now exhausted; the infantry could not follow in regular
formation so fast as their enemy fled; the handful of cavalry was
dispersed, driving in prisoners on every side. So Mahy and O’Donnell
ultimately got off, with their men in a horde scattered over the
country-side—the cavalry leading the stampede and the two rallied
battalions bringing up the rear<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. The Spanish left wing lost over 2,000
prisoners, mainly from Miranda’s division, but only some 400 killed
and wounded; several guns from the divisional batteries were of
course lost. All this was over so early in the day that the fighting
on Blake’s right wing was at its hottest just when the wrecks of his
left were disappearing over the hills. Obispo, who came up too late to
help,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and the two detached battalions under O’Ronan got off separately, more
towards the north, retiring on Naquera.</p>

<p>The tale of this part of the battle of Saguntum is lamentable.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span> There is no record so bad
in the whole war: even the Gebora was a well-contested fight compared
with this—and at Belchite the army that fled so easily gave way before
numbers equal or superior to its own, not inferior in the proportion of
one to three. The fact was that the Valencian troops had a long record
of disasters behind them, were thoroughly demoralized, and could not be
trusted for one moment, and that the Murcians (as Mahy confessed) were
not much better. The defeat was rendered more shameful by the fact that
the smaller half of Blake’s Army, the ‘Expeditionary Force,’ was at the
same moment making head in good style against numbers rather larger
than its own, and seemed for a moment about to achieve a splendid
success. If the Spanish left, 17,000 strong, could have ‘contained’
half its own strength, if it could have kept 8,000 instead of 4,000
French employed for one hour, Blake might have relieved Saguntum and
driven off Suchet. But the story is disgraceful. Mahy wrote next
morning to Blake, ‘I must tell you, with my usual bluntness, that you
had better sell the horses of this cavalry, and draft the men into the
infantry. I could not have believed in the possibility of such conduct,
if I had not seen it with my own eyes take place and cost us so much<a
id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.’ Blake
actually gave orders for one hussar regiment (a Murcian one) to be
deprived of its horses and drafted out. But did the infantry behave
much better?</p>

<p>We may now turn to a less depressing narrative, the story of
the operations of Blake’s own wing. The Commander-in-Chief, as it
will be remembered, had with him the ‘Expeditionary Divisions,’ the
Valencian Reserve Division, and Loy’s and Caro’s 1,100 cavalry. He took
post himself on the height called El Puig, with one brigade of the
Valencians, to the south of the ravine of the Picador, which crosses
the plain in a diagonal direction. The rest of the troops went forward
in two columns: Zayas formed the right near the sea; his flank was
covered by a squadron of gunboats, which advanced parallel with him,
as near the shore as their draught permitted. He was ordered to push
on and get, if possible, round Suchet’s flank, where Habert’s line was
‘refused,’ because of the guns of the flotilla, whose fire the French
wished to avoid. If successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p.
40]</span> Zayas was to try to communicate with the garrison of
Saguntum. Further inland Lardizabal’s division, accompanied by the
1,100 cavalry, and followed by the other brigade of the Valencian
reserve, crossed the Picador at the bridge on the <i>chaussée</i>, and
deployed in the plain, directly opposite Harispe’s division. The whole
force was about equal to the French opposed to it.</p>

<p>The two ‘Expeditionary Divisions’ went forward in good order and
with great confidence: Suchet remarks in his <i>Mémoires</i> that in all his
previous campaigns he had never seen Spanish troops advance with such
resolution or in such good order<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Zayas, on the sea-flank, became immediately
engaged with Habert, before the village of Puzzol, in a heavy fight,
with exactly equal numbers—each had about 2,500 men. Both sides lost
heavily, and neither had any advantage: Suchet had ordered Habert
not to take the offensive till matters were settled in the centre,
but the defensive proved costly, and the Spaniards pushed on—these
were the same battalions which had behaved so well on the hill of
Albuera—Irlanda, Patria, and the Spanish and Walloon Guards.</p>

<p>Further to the left Lardizabal had deployed, after crossing the
ravine, with his two weak brigades in line; the Valencian reserve
remained behind near the bridge, but Loy’s and Caro’s cavalry came
forward on the right in support. Opposite the front brigade (Prieto’s)
was a long low mound, the last outlying spur of the Sancti Espiritus
range. This was soon seen by both sides to be a point of vantage—the
army that could occupy it would have a good artillery position
commanding the hostile line. Suchet ordered up Harispe’s right
battalions to seize it, and galloped thither in person at the head of
his escort of fifty hussars. But the Spaniards had also marked it,
and the Marshal had hardly reached its top when he found Prieto’s
skirmishers swarming up the slope. He had to retire, and rode back to
bring up his infantry; but, by the time that they had come forward,
the enemy had formed a hasty line of battle along the mound, with a
battery in its centre. Suchet had therefore to attack—which he did in
full force, the four battalions of the 7th Line forming a heavy column
in the centre, while those of the 116th and the 3rd of the Vistula
deployed on each side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span>
somewhat to the rear—a clear instance of the use of the <i>ordre mixte</i>
which Napoleon loved. The left flank was covered by two squadrons of
the 4th Hussars and one of the 13th Cuirassiers, brought out from the
reserve.</p>

<p>This was bringing 3,600 bayonets to bear against 1,500, for Prieto’s
brigade counted no more upon the mound. The attack was successful, but
not without severe loss: General Paris, leading on the 7th regiment,
was wounded, as were both his aides-de-camp, and Harispe’s horse was
killed under him; the Spanish artillery fire had been deadly. When
the mound was stormed, the Spanish infantry were forced back, but by
no means in disorder. They formed up again not far from its foot,
and Lardizabal brought up his second brigade to support his first,
placed two batteries in line, and stood to fight again. Suchet, having
re-formed Harispe’s men, found that he had before him a second combat
on the flat ground. The infantry on both sides were heavily engaged,
and six French guns had been brought forward to enfilade Lardizabal’s
right, when a new turn was given to the battle. The Spanish general
ordered Loy’s and Caro’s 1,100 cavalry to charge in mass upon the three
squadrons of hussars and cuirassiers which covered Harispe’s left.
The move was an unexpected one, and was concealed for some time by
scattered carob-trees: the attack was well delivered, and the French
horse, outnumbered by more than two to one, were completely routed and
fled in disorder. Loy then wheeled in upon the French flank, captured
three guns of the battery there placed, and nearly broke the 116th of
the Line, which had only just time to fall back and form itself <i>en
potence</i> to the rest of the division. The remainder of the Spanish
cavalry pursued the retreating hussars.</p>

<p>The moment looked black for the Marshal: he himself confesses
in his <i>Mémoires</i> that if Harispe’s infantry had given way the
battle might have been lost<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"
class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. But he had still a reserve: he sent back
orders to Palombini to bring up Saint Paul’s four Italian battalions
into the gap, and rode himself to the two squadrons of the 13th
Cuirassiers which had not yet advanced into the fight. They were only
350 sabres, but the regiment was a fine one, and had won, at Margalef
and other fields, a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p.
42]</span> confidence in its ability to face long odds. They were
launched straight at the victorious Spanish cavalry, whose main body
was advancing in great disorder, and with its line broken by the groves
of carob-trees, while the remainder had turned inward against the
French infantry. The cuirassiers went straight through the squadrons
opposed to them, and swept them away: whereupon even those units of the
Spanish horse which had not been attacked wheeled round, and retreated
hastily toward the Picador ravine and its bridge. The cuirassiers
followed, upsetting everything in their front, and only halted on the
edge of the ravine, where they were checked by the fire of the battery
attached to the Valencian reserve, and the skirmishers of that body,
who had lined the farther edge of the depression<a id="FNanchor_35"
href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Both the Spanish
brigadiers, Loy and Caro, had behaved very gallantly; both were
severely wounded, while trying to rally their men, and were left on the
field as prisoners.</p>

<p>The defeat of the Spanish horse settled the day, which had for a
moment looked doubtful. At the sight of the French hussars breaking,
and the advance of their own line, the garrison of Saguntum, who had
the whole field in view from their lofty perch, had lined their walls,
cheering and waving their shakos in the air—despite of the shells from
the siege-batteries which continued to play upon them. The cheers died
down as the changed fortunes of the day became visible, and hearts sank
in the fortress. But the fighting was not yet concluded.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">The rout of Loy’s and Caro’s horse had not directly
affected Lardizabal’s infantry, for the victorious cuirassiers had
galloped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> straight
before them after the fugitives, though they had also ridden over
and captured a Spanish battery on the right of the line of deployed
battalions. The decisive blow in this quarter was given by Saint Paul’s
Italians, who, issuing from olive groves behind Harispe’s left, came in
upon the unprotected flank of Lardizabal’s troops, which they rolled
up, driving away at the same time a few squadrons which had not been
affected by the charge of the cuirassiers. These last rode in among
their own infantry, which was already hotly engaged with Harispe’s
battalions, and carried confusion down the line. The division, which
had hitherto fought most gallantly, gave way, and retired in confusion
towards the bridge over the Picador, and the Cartuja where Lardizabal
hoped to sustain himself by means of the battery and the Valencian
reserve battalions which he left there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Blake, from the summit of the knoll of El Puig, had
witnessed with impotent grief the rout of his right centre. He had
placed himself so far to the rear that no orders which he sent reached
Lardizabal in time, and the reserve which he had kept under his
own hand, three raw Valencian battalions and a battery, would have
been too weak to save the day, even if it had not been so far—two
miles—from the central focus of the fight as to make its arrival in
time quite impossible. The General, from the moment that he had given
the original order to advance, exercised no influence whatever on the
operations; one of his staff says that he sat on his horse in blank
and stupid amazement at the rout, and that some of those who watched
him thought him wanting in personal courage no less than in decision<a
id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. But at
last he roused himself to issue orders for the retreat of his broken
left and centre towards Valencia, and for the instant withdrawal of his
still intact right wing.</p>

<p>Here Zayas’s division stood in a most difficult place, for though
it had been contending on equal terms with Habert’s in front of the
village of Puzzol, it is one thing to keep up a standing fight, and
another to withdraw from it with a victorious enemy pushing in upon
the flank. However, Zayas ordered his battalions back, and though
pressed by Habert, brought them in good order across the ravine and
back to the height of El Puig,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p.
44]</span> where Blake stood waiting him with his small reserve. Only
one corps, the Walloon Guards, had thrown itself into the houses of
Puzzol, could not be extracted from them in time, and was surrounded
and captured. But this small disaster did much to save the rest of the
division, for so many of the French closed in upon the village, where
the Walloons made a good stand, that the pursuit was not so hotly
pushed as it might have been. If Suchet could have pressed in upon
Blake before Zayas joined him, the whole Spanish right column might
have been completely cut off from its retreat. But the Marshal required
some leisure to rearrange his line, after routing Lardizabal; and by
the time that he had sent off the rallied 4th Hussars to help Chlopiski
gather in prisoners, and had turned the Italians aside to march against
Blake, with Harispe in support, nearly two hours had gone by, and the
Spanish right, molested only by Habert, was drawing off towards safety.
Following the road along the sea-shore, it reached the suburbs of
Valencia without any further loss.</p>

<p>Not so the unfortunate remnant of Lardizabal’s troops. They had
halted at the Cartuja, behind the Picador, while their general
strove to rally them on the reserve there left. This delay, though
soldier-like and proper, enabled Suchet to catch them up: he charged
them with his last fresh regiment, the 24th Dragoons, which had been
kept in hand, apparently behind Habert’s position, till the retreat of
the Spanish right began. Then, attacking along the high-road, these
squadrons broke in upon the half-rallied troops, swept them away, and
captured two guns put in battery across the <i>chaussée</i>, and badly
supported by the Valencian reserve battalions. Lardizabal’s column went
off in great disorder, and was hunted as far as the Caraixet stream,
losing many prisoners to the dragoons, as well as four flags.</p>

<p>So ended the day; the loss of the Spaniards was not very heavy in
killed and wounded—about 1,000 it is said, mainly in Lardizabal’s
and Zayas’s divisions—for the others did not stand to fight. But
of prisoners they lost 4,641, including 230 officers and the two
wounded cavalry brigadiers. Miranda’s division contributed the
largest proportion to the captives, though Zayas lost 400 men of
the Walloon battalion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p.
45]</span> Lardizabal a still greater number out of his weak
division of 3,000 bayonets<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. Twelve guns were left behind, seven captured
in the hard fighting in the right centre, five from O’Donnell’s
easily-routed divisions. The French casualties are given by Suchet
at about 130 killed and 590 wounded—probably an understatement, as
the regimental returns show 55 officers hit, which at the ordinary
rate of casualties should imply over 1,000 rank and file disabled.
As a commentary on the fighting, it may be remarked that Chlopiski
and Robert, in dealing with Obispo, O’Donnell, and Mahy, had only 7
officers <i>hors de combat</i>, while Harispe and Habert lost 41 in the real
fight with Zayas and Lardizabal<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>The actual losses in action were not the worst part of the battle
of Saguntum—the real disaster was the plain demonstration that the
Valencian troops could not stand even against very inferior numbers. It
was to no purpose that the two gallant ‘Expeditionary Divisions’ had
sacrificed themselves, and lost one man in three out of their small
force of 5,500 men in hard fighting. They had been betrayed by their
worthless associates on the left. Blake’s generalship had not been
good—he dispersed his columns in the most reckless way, and kept no
sufficient reserves—but with the odds in his favour of 27,000 men to
14,000, he ought yet to have won, if the larger half of his army had
consented to fight. They did not: with such troops no more could be
hoped from further battles in the open field—whatever the numerical
odds might be. They could at most be utilized behind walls and
entrenchments, for purely passive defence. And this, as we shall see,
was the deduction that their general made from the unhappy events of
October 25.</p>

<p>Next morning Suchet sent in a summons to the garrison of Saguntum,
and the governor, Andriani, after short haggling for terms,
surrendered. He is not to be blamed: his garrison had seen the rout
of Blake’s army with their own eyes, and knew that there was no more
hope for them. They were, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p.
46]</span> we have seen, mainly raw troops, and their good bearing up
to this moment, rather than their demoralization after the battle,
should provoke notice. The French approaches were by this time within
a few yards of the Dos Mayo redoubt and its hastily patched breaches.
The artillery fire of the besiegers was rapidly levelling the whole
work, and the next storm, made on a wide front of shattered curtain,
must have succeeded. It is true that a governor of the type of Alvarez
of Gerona would then have held out for some time in the castle of San
Fernando. But Andriani’s troops were not like those of Alvarez, and he
himself was a good soldier, but not a fanatical genius. Two thousand
three hundred prisoners marched out on the 26th, leaving not quite
200 men in hospital behind them. The 17 guns of the fortress were
many of them damaged, and the store of shot and shell was very low,
though there were plenty of infantry cartridges left<a id="FNanchor_39"

  <h3 title="CHAPTER III">SECTION XXX: CHAPTER III</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE CAPTURE OF VALENCIA AND OF BLAKE’S ARMY.
    NOVEMBER 1811-JANUARY 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As the</span> result of the disastrous battle of
Saguntum Blake had lost the fortress which had served him so well as an
outwork: while his field army was much decreased in numbers, and still
more in self-confidence. It was obviously impossible that he should
ever again attempt to take the offensive with it. But he was still
in possession of Valencia and all its resources, and his carefully
fortified lines along the Guadalaviar were so strong that even a
defeated army could make some stand behind them. He had still, after
all his losses, more than 22,000 men under arms<a id="FNanchor_40"
href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. Yet it is doubtful
whether a resolute push on the part of the enemy would not have
dislodged him, for more than half his army was in a state of complete
demoralization.</p>

<p>Suchet, however, had made up his mind not to strike at once; and
when a few days had passed, and the Spaniards had been granted time to
settle down into the lines, it would undoubtedly have been hazardous to
attack them with the very modest numbers that the Army of Aragon had
still in line. The chance would have been to press the pursuit hard, on
the very day after the battle. But when the Marshal had counted up his
losses in the trenches and the field, had deducted a small garrison for
Saguntum, and had detached a brigade to escort to Tortosa his numerous
prisoners, he thought himself too weak for a decisive blow. He would
not have had 15,000 men in hand, unless he should call up Ficatier’s
brigade from Segorbe and Oropesa, and this he did not want to do, as
he was entirely dependent for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p.
48]</span> food and stores on the line of communication which Ficatier
was guarding. Accordingly he resolved to defer his next blow at Blake,
till he should have summoned from Aragon Severoli’s division, and
Reille’s too, if the Emperor would give him leave to requisition that
force. He could not utilize Reille without that leave; but Severoli’s
troops belonged to his own army, and were at his disposition, if he
should judge it possible to draw them southward without endangering the
safety of Aragon. This he was prepared to do, if a sufficient garrison
for that province could be provided from another source. And the only
obvious source was the Army of the North: if the Emperor would consent
to order Dorsenne to find troops to make Saragossa and the line of the
Ebro secure, it would not be over rash to borrow both Severoli and
Reille for operations against Valencia. But it was clear that it would
take some weeks for the permission to be sent from Paris, and for the
troops of the Army of the North to be moved, when and if the permission
was granted. We shall see, as a matter of fact, that it was not till
the end of December, two full months after the battle of Saguntum, that
the two divisions were collected on the desired ground, and the final
blow against Blake was delivered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Suchet could do no more than place his divisions in the
most favourable position for making the advance that would only be
possible when Severoli, and perhaps Reille also, should arrive. With
this object he pushed them forward on November 3 to the line of the
Guadalaviar, close in front of Blake’s long series of entrenchments.
Harispe on the right advanced to Paterna, Habert on the left to the
close neighbourhood of Valencia. He drove the Spanish outposts from
the outlying suburb of Serranos, which lay beyond the lines and on
the north side of the river, and also from the Grao, or port and mole
which forms the outlet of Valencia to the sea. It was most unlucky for
Blake, in the end, that his natural line of communication with the
Mediterranean and the English fleet lay north of the Guadalaviar, and
outside his line of fortifications. Indeed it looks as if there was
a cardinal fault in the planning of the defences when the Grao was
left outside them, for though rather remote from the city (two miles)
it would be of inestimable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p.
49]</span> importance, supposing that the French were to succeed in
crossing the Guadalaviar and investing Valencia. With the port safe,
the defenders could receive succour and supplies to any extent, and if
finally reduced to extremity could retreat by sea. Some of the energy
which had been expended in throwing up the immense fortified camp which
embraced all the southern suburbs, and in lining the river westward
with batteries, might well have been diverted to the fortification of
the Grao and its connexion with the works of the city. But probably
Blake, in his looking forward to the possible events of the future, did
not contemplate among the contingencies to be faced that of his being
shut up with the greater part of his army within the walls of Valencia.
If he were forced from the lines of the Guadalaviar, he must have
intended to fall back inland or southward, and not to allow himself to
be surrounded in the capital. Otherwise it would have been absolutely
insane for him to leave unfortified, and abandon without a struggle,
Valencia’s sole outlet to the sea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile finding himself for week after week unassailed in his
lines, Blake had to take stock of his position, and see if there was
anything that he could do to avert the attack which must come one day,
and which would obviously be formidable. For it had become known to
him, ere long, that Severoli’s division, and probably other troops,
were working in towards Valencia, and would certainly join Suchet
before the winter was over. The only expedients of which Blake made
use were to keep masses of men continuously at work strengthening his
lines, and to renew the attempt, which he had made fruitlessly in
September, for loosing Suchet’s hold on Valencia by launching against
his rear the irregulars of Aragon—the bands of the Empecinado, Duran,
and the minor chiefs. To add some solidity to their hordes he detached
from his army the Conde de Montijo, with one of the two brigades which
Mahy had brought from Murcia. This turbulent nobleman, more noted for
his intrigues than for his fighting power, was given a general command
over all the bands, and marched to join them with three battalions<a
id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and a
few guns—the latter provision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p.
50]</span> was intended to obviate the difficulty which the irregulars
had experienced in October from their want of artillery. Blake intended
to call up Freire from Murcia with another draft from the depleted
‘Third Army,’ whose best troops Mahy had already led to Valencia. But,
as we shall see, this detachment was presently distracted to another
quarter, and never joined the main force. The nominal strength of
the mass of troops along the Guadalaviar was, however, increased by
degrees, owing to the filling of the ranks of the divisions cut up at
Saguntum by men from the half-trained reserve and dépôts. Miranda’s
division in particular, which had lost so many prisoners in the battle,
was completed to more than its original strength by absorbing three raw
‘third battalions’ from the ‘Reserve Division,’ besides other drafts<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. Blake
also endeavoured to make use of ‘urban guards’ and other levies of
irregular organization and more than doubtful value: the population
in the north of the kingdom, behind Suchet’s lines, were invited to
form guerrillero bands: but the Valencians never showed the zeal or
energy of the Catalans and Aragonese. The bands that appeared were few
in numbers, and accomplished nothing of note. Indeed, it appears that
the patriotic spirit of the province had run low. Mahy, in a letter
to Blake of this month, complains bitterly that the peasantry refuse
to convey letters for him, or even to give him information as to the
position and movements of the French, while he knew that hundreds
of them were visiting Suchet’s camps daily in friendly fashion<a
id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. It
appears that the people were sick of the war, and discontented with
Blake, whose conduct to the local authorities was even more injurious
to him than the uniform failure of all his military operations.</p>

<p>The diversion to be conducted by Montijo and the irregulars in
Aragon constituted the only real hope of salvation for Blake and the
city of Valencia. But it was, we may say, doomed from the first to
failure, unless some favourable chance should intervene. A couple of
thousand regulars, with the aid of guerrillero bands, hard to assemble,
and not mustering at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p.
51]</span> time more than 6,000 or 7,000 men collected on one spot,
were sent to paralyse the movements of more than 20,000 French. For
to that figure Reille’s and Severoli’s divisions, together with
the original garrison left in Aragon under Musnier, most certainly
amounted. It cannot be denied that the diversion gave much trouble to
the enemy, but it never prevented him from executing any operation of
primary importance. On October 27th the Italian general, Mazzuchelli,
with one of Severoli’s brigades, drove off the Empecinado, and
relieved the long-besieged garrison of Molina, which he brought off,
abandoning the castle. But as he was returning to his chief, who then
lay at Daroca, the Empecinado fell on his marching column in the Pass
of Cubillejo, and inflicted severe damage upon it<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. Severoli then sent out a
second column of 800 men, to relieve Almunia, on the road to Saragossa,
another outlying garrison. But Duran surprised and scattered this party
just as it reached its destination, and then captured the fort with
its garrison of 140 men (October 31). This provoked the enemy to march
against him in force, whereupon, after fighting an obstinate engagement
with Mazzuchelli near Almunia, in which the Italians lost 220 men, he
turned sideways, and descended upon Daroca, which his adversary had
left weakly manned; he stormed the town and laid siege to the fort.
This brought down upon him Pannetier, with one of Reille’s brigades:
thereupon, wisely refusing to fight, Duran went up into the mountains
of Molina (November 1811).</p>

<p>Here he was joined some weeks later by the regular brigade under
the Conde de Montijo, which Blake had sent up from Valencia. This
little detachment had threaded its way among Reille’s columns, and had
narrowly escaped destruction near Albarracin. The Conde, assuming chief
command at the high-lying village of Mulmarcos, informed the Aragonese
guerrilleros that something desperate must be done, to relieve the
pressure on Valencia; and after sending for the Empecinado, who was
now beyond the mountains, in the province of Guadalajara, marched on
Calatayud. Unfortunately the Partida chiefs, accustomed to conduct
their expeditions on their own responsibility, viewed the advent of
Montijo, a stranger of no great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p.
52]</span> military reputation, with jealousy and dislike. Duran and
the Conde having reached Ateca near Calatayud, committed themselves
to a serious combat with a column of 2,000 men from its garrison,
having every expectation of being succoured by the Empecinado, who had
reached their neighbourhood. He did not appear, however, and they were
repulsed. Thereupon the Spaniards parted, the Conde and the regulars
retiring to Torrehermosa, Duran to Deza, in the province of Soria. The
Empecinado, when all was over, sent in a letter in which he explained
that he had held off ‘because his officers and soldiers had no
confidence save in their own chief:’ but it was clear that he himself
wrecked the expedition out of self-willed indiscipline.</p>

<p>The month of December was now far advanced, and nothing effective
had been done to help Blake. The Aragonese bands had cost Reille and
Severoli many toilsome marches, and had inflicted on them appreciable
losses—Severoli’s division was now 2,000 men weaker than it had been in
September. But they had failed entirely to stop the larger movements
of the enemy, who was able to move wherever he pleased with a column
of 3,000 men, though any lesser force was always in danger of being
harried or even destroyed. When Suchet determined that he would
again risk trouble in his rear, and would bring both the divisions
from the Ebro down to Valencia, no one could prevent him from doing
so. It is true that Severoli and Reille were leaving behind them a
country-side still infested by an active and obstinate enemy. But if
their generalissimo judged that he was prepared to take this risk, and
was determined to crush Blake before he completed the subjugation of
Upper Aragon, there was nothing that could hinder him from carrying out
his intention. By the middle of December Severoli was on his way to
the Guadalaviar by way of Teruel, and Reille followed not far behind,
though one of his brigades (Bourke’s) had been distracted, by being
ordered to conduct the prisoners from Saguntum to the French frontier,
and the other (Pannetier’s) had been drawn so far northward in hunting
Montijo and Duran that it was several marches behind the leading
columns.</p>

<p>It was not, however, Reille and Severoli alone who were set<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> in motion for the ruin
of Blake and Valencia. Nor was Suchet’s mind the final controlling
force of the operations which were to spread all over eastern Spain
in the months of December 1811 and January 1812. The Emperor, when
he hurried the Army of Aragon forward in September, had explained
that this was the crucial point of the war, and repeated in November
that ‘l’important, dans ce moment, est la prise de Valence.’ Portugal
could wait—Wellington, with 18,000 men sick, and forced to remain
on the defensive,—was a negligible quantity during the winter:
he should be dealt with in the spring by a general combination
of all the French armies<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. Acting on this comfortable but erroneous
hypothesis, Napoleon determined to shift eastward and southward not
only Reille and Severoli, but other troops from the armies which were
directly or indirectly opposed to Wellington, so as to alter for a
time the general balance of forces on the Portuguese side of the
Peninsula. On October 18th, before the battle of Saguntum had been
fought and won, Berthier had been directed to write to Marmont that,
for the support of the invasion of Valencia, King Joseph and the Army
of the Centre would be ordered to send troops to Cuenca, to take Blake
in the rear. In consequence the Army of Portugal must ‘facilitate the
task of the King,’ i. e. find detachments to occupy those parts of New
Castile from which Joseph would have to withdraw the normal garrison
for his expedition to Cuenca. But presently it became evident that the
Army of the Centre would have great difficulty in providing a column
strong enough to make this diversion, even if it were relieved in La
Mancha, or the province of Toledo, by units belonging to Marmont.
Napoleon then made the all-important determination to borrow troops
from the Army of Portugal for the Valencian expedition. By this time
he knew of the battle of Saguntum, and had received Suchet’s appeals
for reinforcements. His dispatch to Marmont of November 20th informs
the Marshal that he must provide a division of 6,000 men of all
arms, to join the disposable force which King Joseph can spare for
the assistance of Suchet. The still more important dispatch of the
next day varied the orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p.
54]</span> in an essential detail, by saying that the Marshal must
send not ‘a detachment of 6,000 men’ but <i>such a force as, united
to the column supplied by King Joseph, would provide a total of
12,000 men for the diversion</i>.’ And it was added that, in addition,
the Army of Portugal would have to find 3,000 or 4,000 men more, to
keep up the communications of the expeditionary force with its base
in New Castile. The detachment might be made without any fear of
adverse consequences, since Wellington had 20,000 men in hospital,
and barely as many in a state to take the field, so no risk would
be run in depleting the force opposed to him<a id="FNanchor_46"
href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. Napoleon, conveniently
ignoring the exact wording of his own dispatch, reproached Marmont
(when evil results had followed) for having detached ‘an army corps and
thirty guns’ for the diversion, instead of ‘a light flying column.<a
id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>’ But it
will be seen that the Marshal was literally obeying the orders given
him when he moved 12,000 men towards Valencia. For the Army of the
Centre provided not much more than 3,000 men under General d’Armagnac
for the Cuenca expedition<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, and Marmont had, therefore, to find 9,000
men to bring it up to the strength which the Emperor prescribed, as
well as the 3,000-4,000 men to cover the line of communications.</p>

<p>All these dispatches reached Marmont’s head-quarters at Plasencia
with the tardiness that was normal in Spain, where officers bearing
orders had to be escorted by detachments many hundreds strong,
supposing that their certain arrival at their destination was desired.
If they travelled rapidly and unescorted, they became the inevitable
prey of the guerrilleros. The dispatch of October 18th, saying that
Marmont must replace King Joseph’s garrisons in La Mancha, came to hand
on November 11, and the Marshal accordingly directed Foy’s division,
then at Toledo, to break itself up and occupy the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span> various posts which the German division of
the Army of the Centre had been holding. Foy set out to fulfil these
orders on November 22.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s second and third dispatches, those of November
20-21st, turned up on December 13th<a id="FNanchor_49"
href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, and Marmont found
himself under orders to find 9,000 men for the Cuenca expedition,—since
d’Armagnac had only 3,000 men to contribute—and in addition 3,000-4,000
more for the line of communications. Now the Marshal was as fully
convinced as his master that Wellington was not in a condition to
move, or to do any serious harm, and under this impression, and being
probably stirred (as Napoleon afterwards remarked)<a id="FNanchor_50"
href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> by the desire to
increase his own reputation by a dashing feat of arms, he resolved
to take charge of the expedition in person. He ordered that the
divisions of Foy and Sarrut—both weak units, the one of eight, the
other of nine battalions<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a>—and Montbrun’s light cavalry should prepare
to march under his own charge to join d’Armagnac, and move on Valencia.
Another division should come into La Mancha to take up the cantonments
evacuated by Foy, and keep over the line of communications. Clausel
should be left in charge of the remainder of the army, and observe
Wellington.</p>

<p>This scheme was never carried out, for on December 20 Marmont
received another dispatch, ordering him to transfer his head-quarters
to Valladolid, and to move a large part of his army into Old Castile.
Of this more hereafter. But being thus prevented (for his own good
fortune as it turned out) from going on the expedition, he gave over
Foy’s and Sarrut’s divisions to Montbrun, and bade him execute the
diversion. He himself went, as ordered, to Valladolid. If he had
received the last dispatch a little later, or had started a little
earlier, he would have been put in the ignominious position of being
absent from his own point of danger, when Wellington suddenly struck at
Ciudad Rodrigo in the early days of January.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>Montbrun, his
substitute, had drawn together his forces in La Mancha by the 29th of
December, but receiving from d’Armagnac, who was already on the move
with 3,000 men, the assurance that the road from Cuenca to Valencia was
practically impassable at midwinter, and that he could certainly get
no guns along it, he resolved to take another route towards the scene
of active operations. Accordingly he set out to march by the road San
Clemente, Chinchilla, Almanza, which runs across the upland plain of
La Mancha and Northern Murcia, and does not cross rough ground till
it nears the descent to the sea-coast on the borders of Valencia. The
column did not leave San Clemente and El Probencio till January 2, and
(as we shall see) was too late to help Suchet, who had brought matters
to a head long before it drew near him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile d’Armagnac, though his force was trifling<a
id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, had
been of far greater use. He had reoccupied Cuenca, but finding (as
he had informed Montbrun) that the roads in that direction were
impracticable, had swerved southward, avoiding the mountains, and
getting to Tarazona in La Mancha, marched towards the passes of the
Cabriel River, and the road on to Valencia by way of Requeña. His
approach being reported to Blake, who had no troops in this direction
save two battalions under Bassecourt, the Captain-General was seized
with a natural disquietude as to his rear, for he had no accurate
knowledge of the French strength. Wherefore he directed General
Freire, with the succours which he had been intending to draw up from
Murcia, to abandon the idea of reinforcing the main army, and to throw
himself between d’Armagnac and Valencia [November 20]. The French
general, beating the country on all sides, and thrusting before him
Bassecourt’s small force and the local guerrilleros, marched as far
as Yniesta, and forced the passage of the Cabriel at Valdecañas, but
finding that he had got far away from Montbrun, who did not march
till many days after he himself had started, and being informed
that Freire, with a very large force, was coming in upon his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> rear, he stopped before
reaching Requeña and turned back towards La Mancha<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. He had succeeded,
however, in preventing Freire from reinforcing Valencia, and the
Murcian succours never got near to Blake. He even for a time distracted
troops from the main Spanish army, for Zayas was sent for some days
to Requeña, and only returned just in time for the operations that
began on December 25th. The net outcome, therefore, of Montbrun’s and
d’Armagnac’s operations was simply to distract Freire’s division from
Valencia at the critical moment—an appreciable but not a decisive
result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Suchet found himself able to deliver his decisive blow on
the Guadalaviar. By his orders Severoli and Reille had drawn southward
by way of Teruel, deliberately abandoning most of Aragon to the mercy
of the insurgent bands; for though Caffarelli had moved some battalions
of the Army of the North to Saragossa and the posts along the Ebro,
the rest of the province was left most inadequately guarded by the
small force that had originally been committed to Musnier’s charge,
when first Suchet marched on Valencia. Musnier himself accompanied
Severoli’s division, leaving his detachments under Caffarelli’s orders,
for he had been directed to come to the front and assume the command
of his old brigades, those of Ficatier and Robert, both now with the
main army. When Reille and the Italians marched south, Aragon was
exposed to the inroads of Montijo, Duran, the Empecinado, and Mina,
all of whom had been harried, but by no means crushed, by the late
marches and countermarches of the French. That trouble would ensue both
Napoleon and Suchet were well aware. But the Emperor had made up his
mind that all other considerations were to be postponed to the capture
of Valencia and the destruction of Blake’s army. When these ends were
achieved, not only Reille and Severoli, but other troops as well,
should be drawn northwards, to complete the pacification of Aragon, and
to make an end of the lingering war in Catalonia.</p>

<p>Severoli had reached Teruel on November 30, but was ordered to
await the junction of Reille’s troops, and these were still<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> far off. Indeed Reille
himself only started from Saragossa with Bourke’s brigade on December
10th, and Pannetier’s brigade (which had been hunting Duran in the
mountains) was two long marches farther behind. Without waiting for its
junction, Severoli and Reille marched from Teruel on December 20th, and
reached Segorbe unopposed on the 24th. Here they were in close touch
with Suchet, and received orders to make a forced march to join him,
as he intended to attack the lines of the Guadalaviar on the 26th. To
them was allotted the most important move in the game, for they were
to cross the Guadalaviar high up, beyond the westernmost of Blake’s
long string of batteries and earthworks, and to turn his flank and get
in his rear, while the Army of Aragon assailed his front, and held him
nailed to his positions by a series of vigorous attacks. The point on
which Reille and Severoli were to march was Ribaroja, fifteen miles
up-stream from Valencia.</p>

<p>When the two divisions from Aragon should have arrived, Suchet could
count on 33,000 men in line, but as Pannetier was still labouring up
two marches in the rear, it was really with 30,000 only that he struck
his blow—a force exceeding that which Blake possessed by not more
than 6,000 or 7,000 bayonets. Considering the strength of the Spanish
fortifications the task looked hazardous: but Suchet was convinced,
and rightly, that the greater part of the Army of Valencia was still
so much demoralized that much might be dared against it: and the event
proved him wise.</p>

<p>On the night of December 25th all the divisions of the Army of
Aragon had abandoned their cantonments, and advanced towards the
Spanish lines—Habert on the left next the sea; Palombini to the west
of Valencia, opposite the village of Mislata; Harispe and Musnier
farther up-stream, opposite Quarte. The cavalry accompanied this
last column. Reille and Severoli, on their arrival, were to form the
extreme right of the line, and would extend far beyond the last Spanish
entrenchments. The weak Neapolitan division alone (now not much over
1,000 strong) was to keep quiet, occupying the entrenched position in
the suburb of Serranos, which faced the city of Valencia. Its only
duty was to hold on to its works, in case Blake should try a sortie at
this spot, with the purpose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p.
59]</span> breaking the French line in two. That such a weak force was
left to discharge such an important function, is a sufficient proof of
Suchet’s belief in Blake’s incapacity to take the offensive.</p>

<p>The lines which the French were about to assail were rather long
than strong, despite of the immense amount of labour that had been
lavished on them during the last three months. Their extreme right,
on the side of the sea, and by the mouth of the Guadalaviar was a
redoubt (named after the Lazaretto hard by) commanding the estuary:
from thence a long line of earthworks continued the defences as far
as the slight hill of Monte Oliveto, which guarded the right flank of
the great entrenched camp of which the city formed the nucleus. Here
there was a fort outside the walls, and connected with them by a ditch
and a bastioned line of earthworks, reaching as far as the citadel at
the north-east corner of the town. From thence the line of resistance
for some way was formed of the mediaeval wall of Valencia itself,
thirty feet high and ten thick. It was destitute of a parapet broad
enough to bear guns: but the Spaniards had built up against its back,
at irregular distances, scaffolding of heavy beams, and terraces of
earth, on which a certain amount of cannon were mounted. The gates were
protected by small advanced works, mounting artillery. Blake had made
Valencia and its three outlying southern and western suburbs of Ruzafa,
San Vincente, and Quarte into a single place of defence, by building
around those suburbs a great line of earthworks and batteries. It was
an immense work consisting of bastioned entrenchments provided with
a ditch eighteen feet deep, and filled in some sections with water.
From the city the line of defence along the river continued as far
as the village of Manises, with an unbroken series of earthworks and
batteries. The Guadalaviar itself formed an outer obstacle, being a
stream running through low and marshy ground, and diverted into many
water-cuts for purposes of irrigation.</p>

<p>The continuous line of defences from the sea as far as Manises was
about eight miles long. It possessed some outworks on the farther bank
of the Guadalaviar, three of the five bridges which lead from Valencia
northward having been left standing by Blake, with good <i>têtes-de-pont</i>
to protect them from Suchet’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p.
60]</span> attacks. Thus the Spaniards had the power to debouch on
to the French side of the river at any time that they pleased. This
fact added difficulties to the projected attack which the Marshal was
planning.</p>

<p>The troops behind the lines of the Guadalaviar consisted of some
23,000 regulars, with a certain amount of local urban guards and
armed peasantry whose number it is impossible to estimate with any
precision—probably they gave some 3,000 muskets more, but their
fighting value was almost negligible. The right of the line, near
the sea, was entirely made over to these levies of doubtful value.
Miranda’s division manned the fort of Monte Oliveto and the whole north
front of the city. Lardizabal garrisoned the earthworks from the end of
the town wall as far as the village of Mislata. This last place and its
works fell to the charge of Zayas. Creagh’s Murcians were on Zayas’s
left at Quarte: finally the western wing of the army was formed by
the Valencian divisions of Obispo and Villacampa; holding San Onofre
and Manises, where the fortifications ended. The whole of the cavalry
was placed so as to cover the left rear of the lines, at Aldaya and
Torrente. A few battalions of the raw ‘Reserve Division’ were held in
the city as a central reserve. The arrangements of Blake seem liable
to grave criticism, since he placed his two good and solid divisions,
those of Lardizabal and Zayas, in the strongest works in the centre of
his line, but entrusted his left flank, where a turning movement by
the French might most easily take place, to the demoralized battalions
of Villacampa and Obispo, who had a consistent record of rout and
disaster behind them. It is clear that lines, however long, can always
be turned, unless their ends rest, as did those of Torres Vedras, on
an impassable obstacle such as the sea. If the French should refuse
to attack the works in front, and should march up the Guadalaviar to
far beyond the last battery, it would be impossible to prevent them
from crossing, all the more so because, after Manises, the network of
canals and water-cuts, which makes the passage difficult in the lower
course of the river, comes to an end, and the only obstacle exposed to
the invader is a single stream of no great depth. Blake, therefore,
should have seen that the critical point was the extreme west end
of his lines, and should have placed there<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span> his best troops instead of his worst.
Moreover he appears to have had no proper system of outposts of either
cavalry or infantry along the upper stream, for (as we shall see) the
first passage of the French was made not only without opposition, but
without any alarm being given. Yet there were 2,000 Spanish cavalry
only a few miles away, at Torrente and Aldaya.</p>

<p>Suchet’s plan of attack, which he carried out the moment that Reille
joined him, and even before the latter’s rearmost brigade had got up
into line, was a very ambitious one, aiming not merely at the forcing
of the Guadalaviar or the investment of Valencia, but at the trapping
of the whole Spanish army. It was conducted on such a broad front, and
with such a dispersion of the forces into isolated columns, that it
argued a supreme contempt for Blake and his generalship. Used against
such a general as Wellington it would have led to dreadful disaster.
But Suchet knew his adversary.</p>

<p>The gist of the plan was the circumventing of the Spanish lines by
two columns which, starting one above and the other below Valencia,
were to cross the river and join hands to the south of the city.
Meanwhile the main front of the works was to be threatened (and
if circumstances favoured, attacked) by a very small fraction of
the French army. Near the sea Habert’s division was to force the
comparatively weak line of works at the estuary, and then to cut the
road which runs from Valencia between the Mediterranean and the great
lagoon of the Albufera. Far inland the main striking force of the army,
composed of the divisions of Harispe and Musnier, with all the cavalry,
and with Reille’s three brigades following close behind, was to pass
the Guadalaviar at Ribaroja, three or four miles above Manises, and
from thence to extend along the south front of the Spanish lines, take
them in the rear, and push on so as to get into touch with Habert.
Compère’s weak Neapolitan brigade was to block the bridge-heads out of
which Blake might make a sally northward. Palombini’s Italians were
to press close up to Mislata, which Suchet judged to be the weakest
point in the Spanish lines, and to deliver against it an attack which
was to be pushed more or less home as circumstances might dictate. The
whole force employed (not counting Pannetier’s brigade, which had not
yet joined Reille) was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p.
62]</span> 30,000 men. Of these 25,000 were employed in the flanking
movements; less than 5,000 were left to demonstrate against Blake’s
front along the lines of the Guadalaviar.</p>

<p>The main and decisive blow was of course to be delivered by Harispe,
Musnier, and Reille, who were to cross the river at a point where the
Spaniards were unlikely to make any serious opposition, since it was
outside their chosen ground of defence, and was clearly watched rather
than held. If 20,000 men crossed here, and succeeded in establishing
themselves south of Valencia by a rapid march, Blake would find his
lines useless, and would be forced to fight in the open, in order to
secure a retreat southward, or else to shut himself and his whole force
up in the entrenched camp around the city. Suchet could accept either
alternative with equanimity: a battle, as he judged, meant a victory,
the breaking up of the Spanish army and the capture of Valencia. If,
on the other hand, Blake refused to fight a general engagement, and
retired within his camp, it would lead to his being surrounded, and
the desired end would only be deferred for a few days. There were only
two dangers—one was that the Spanish general might abscond southward
with the bulk of his army, without fighting, the moment that he heard
that his enemy was across the Guadalaviar. The second was that, waiting
till the French main body was committed to its flank march, he might
break out northward by the three bridges in his hands, overwhelm the
Neapolitans, and escape towards Liria and Segorbe into the mountains.
Suchet judged that his enemy would try neither of these courses; he
would not be timid enough to retreat on the instant that he learnt that
his left wing was beginning to be turned; nor would he be resourceful
enough to strike away northward, as soon as he saw that the turning
movement was formidable and certain of success. Herein Suchet judged
aright.</p>

<p>At nightfall on the 25th-26th of December two hundred hussars, each
carrying a voltigeur behind him, forded the Guadalaviar at Ribaroja,
and threw out a chain of posts which brushed off a few Spanish cavalry
vedettes. The moment that the farther bank was clear, the whole
force of Suchet’s engineers set to work to build two trestle-bridges
for infantry, and to lay a solid pontoon bridge higher up for guns
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span> cavalry. A few
hours later Harispe’s division began to pass—then Musnier’s, lastly
Boussard’s cavalry. The defile took a long time, and even by dawn
Reille’s three brigades had not arrived or begun to pass. But by that
time ten thousand French were over the river. The Spanish vedettes had
reported, both to their cavalry generals at Aldaya and to Blake at
Valencia, that the enemy was busy at Ribaroja, but had not been able to
judge of his force, or to make out that he was constructing bridges.
Their commanders resolved that nothing could be done in the dark, and
that the morning light would determine the character of the movement<a
id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>The late December sun soon showed the situation. Harispe’s division
was marching on Torrente, to cut the high-road to Murcia. The cavalry
and one brigade of Musnier were preparing to follow: the other brigade
of the second division (Robert’s) was standing fast by the bridges, to
cover them till Reille should appear and cross. But while this was the
most weighty news brought to Blake, he was distracted by intelligence
from two other quarters. Habert was clearly seen coming down by the
seaside, to attack at the estuary; and Palombini was also approaching
in the centre, in front of Mislata. The daylight was the signal for the
commencement of skirmishing on each of the three far-separated points.
Blake, strange as it may appear, made up his mind at first that the
real danger lay on the side next the sea, and that Habert’s column
was the main striking force<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. But when it became clear that this wing
of the French army was not very strong, and was coming on slowly, he
turned his attention to Palombini, whose attack on Mislata was made
early, and was conducted in a vigorous style. It was to this point that
he finally rode out from the city, and he took up his position behind
Zayas, entirely neglecting the turning movement on his left—apparently
because it was out of sight, and he could not make the right deduction
from the reports which his cavalry had brought him.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span></p> <p>Meanwhile Harispe’s
column, pushing forward with the object of reaching the high-road
from Valencia to Murcia, the natural route for Blake’s army to take,
if it should attempt to escape southward, ran into the main body of
the Spanish horse, which was assembling in the neighbourhood of the
village of Aldaya. The French infantry were preceded by a squadron of
hussars, who were accompanied by General Boussard, the commander of
Suchet’s cavalry division. This small force was suddenly encompassed
and cut up by several regiments of Martin Carrera’s brigade. Boussard
was overthrown and left for dead—his sword and decorations were
stripped from his body. But more French squadrons began to come up,
and Harispe’s infantry opened fire on the Spaniards, who were soon
forced to retire hurriedly—they rode off southward towards the Xucar
river. They were soon completely out of touch with the rest of Blake’s
army.</p>

<p>Harispe’s column then continued its way, sweeping eastward towards
the Murcian <i>chaussée</i> in the manner that Suchet had designed; but the
rest of the operations of the French right wing were not so decisive
as its commander had hoped. Mahy, learning of the movement of the
encircling column, and seeing Robert’s brigade massed opposite the
extreme flank of his position at Manises, while some notice of Reille’s
near approach also came to hand, suddenly resolved that he would not
be surrounded, and abandoned all his lines before they were seriously
attacked. He had the choice of directing Villacampa and Obispo to
retire towards Valencia and join Blake for a serious battle in the
open, or of bidding them strike off southward and eastward, and escape
towards the Xucar, abandoning the main body of the army. He chose the
second alternative, and marched off parallel with Harispe’s threatening
column, directing each brigade to get away as best it could. His force
at once broke up into several fractions, for the cross-roads were many
and perplexing. Some regiments reached the Murcian <i>chaussée</i> before
Harispe, and escaped in front of him, pursued by the French cavalry.
Others, coming too late, were forced to forgo this obvious line of
retreat, and to struggle still farther eastward, only turning south
when they got to the marshy borders of the lagoon of Albufera. Obispo,
with 2,000 of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span>
men, was so closely hunted by the hostile cavalry that he barely found
safety by striking along the narrow strip of soft ground between the
lagoon and the sea. On the morning of the 27th he struggled through
to Cullera near the mouth of the Xucar: Mahy, with the greater part
of Villacampa’s division and some of Obispo’s and Creagh’s, arrived
somewhat earlier at Alcira, higher up the same stream, where he found
the fugitive cavalry already established. The divisions were much
disorganized, but they had lost very few killed or wounded, and not
more than 500 prisoners. Mahy rallied some 4,000 or 5,000 men at
Alcira, and Obispo a couple of thousand at Cullera, but they were a
‘spent force,’ not fit for action. Many of the raw troops had disbanded
themselves and gone home.</p>

    VALENCIA The Siege (Dec 1811-Jan 1812)
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">Thus three-sevenths of Blake’s army were separated
from Valencia and their Commander-in-Chief without having made any
appreciable resistance. But it seems doubtful whether Mahy should be
blamed—if he had waited an hour longer in his positions his whole corps
might have been captured. If he had retired towards Valencia he would
have been, in all probability, forced to surrender with the rest of
the army a few days later. And in separating himself from his chief he
had the excuse that he knew that Blake’s intention had been to retire
towards the Xucar if beaten, not to shut himself up in Valencia. He may
have expected that the rest of the army would follow him southward,
and Blake (as we shall see) probably had the chance of executing that
movement, though he did not seize it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the progress of the engagement in other quarters must be
detailed. Palombini made a serious attempt to break through the left
centre of the Spanish lines at Mislata. His task was hard, not so
much because of the entrenchments, or of the difficulty of crossing
the Guadalaviar, which was fordable for infantry, but from the many
muddy canals and water-cuts with which the ground in front of him
abounded. These, though not impassable for infantry, prevented guns
from getting to the front till bridges should have been made for them.
The Italians waded through the first canal, and then through the river,
but were brought to a stand by the second canal, that of Fabara, behind
which the Spanish entrenchments lay. After<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> a furious fire-contest they had to retire
as far as the river, under whose bank many sought refuge—some plunged
in and waded back to the farther side. Palombini rallied them and
delivered a second attack; but at only one point, to the left of
Mislata, did the assault break into the Spanish line. Zayas, aided by
a battalion or two which Mahy had sent up from Quarte, vindicated his
position, and repulsed the attack with heavy loss. But when the news
came from the left that Harispe had turned the lines, and when Mahy’s
troops were seen evacuating all their positions and hurrying off, Zayas
found himself with his left flank completely exposed.</p>

<p>Blake made some attempt to form a line <i>en potence</i> to Zayas’s
entrenchments, directing two or three of Creagh’s battalions from
Quarte and some of his reserve from the city to make a stand at the
village of Chirivella. But the front was never formed—attacked by some
of Musnier’s troops these detachments broke up, Creagh’s men flying to
follow Mahy, and the others retiring to the entrenched camp.</p>

<p>Thereupon Blake ordered Zayas and Lardizabal, who lay to his
right, to retreat into Valencia before they should be turned by the
approaching French. The movement was accomplished in order and at
leisure, and all the guns in and about the Mislata entrenchments were
brought away. Palombini had been too hardly handled to attempt to
pursue.</p>

<p>The General-in-Chief seemed stunned by the suddenness of the
disaster. ‘He looked like a man of stone,’ says Schepeler, who rode at
his side, ‘when any observation was made to him he made no reply, and
he could come to no decision. He would not allow Zayas to fight, and
when a colonel (the author of this work) suggested at the commencement
of the retreat that it would be well to burn certain houses which lay
dangerously close to the entrenched camp, he kept silence. Whereupon
Zayas observed in bitter rage to this officer: “Truly you are dull,
my German friend; do you not see that you cannot wake the man up?”’
According to the narratives of several contemporaries there would
still have been time at this moment to direct the retreating column
southward and escape, as Obispo did, along the Albufera. For Habert
(as we shall see) had been much slower than Harispe in his turning
movement by the side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p.
67]</span> Mediterranean. Some, among them Schepeler, suggest that the
whole garrison might have broken out by the northern bridges and got
away. For Palombini was not in a condition to hinder them, and the
Neapolitans in front of the bridge-heads were but a handful of 1,200
men. But the General, still apparently unconscious of what was going on
about him, drew back into the entrenched camp, and did no more.</p>

<p>Habert, meanwhile, finally completed his movement, and joined hands
with Harispe at last. His lateness was to be accounted for not by the
strength of the opposition made by the irregular troops in front of
him, but by the fact that his advance had been much hindered by the
fire of the flotilla lying off the mouth of the Guadalaviar. Here there
was a swarm of gunboats supported by a British 74 and a frigate. Habert
would not commence his passage till he had driven them away, by placing
a battery of sixteen siege-guns on the shore near the Grao. After much
firing the squadron sheered off<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, and about midday the French division crossed
the Guadalaviar, partly by fording, partly on a hastily constructed
bridge, and attacked the line of scattered works defended by irregulars
which lay behind. The Spaniards were successively evicted from all
of them, as far as the fort of Monte Oliveto. Miranda’s division
kept within the entrenched camp, and gave no assistance to the bands
without; but it was late afternoon before Habert had accomplished his
task, and finally got into touch with Harispe.</p>

<p>Blake was thus shut up in Valencia with the divisions of Miranda,
Zayas, and Lardizabal, and what was left of his raw reserve battalions:
altogether some 17,000 fighting-men remained with him. The loss in
actual fighting had been very small—about 500 killed and wounded and as
many prisoners. The French captured a good many guns in the evacuated
works and a single standard. Suchet returned his total casualties at
521 officers and men, of whom no less than 50 killed and 355 wounded
were among Palombini’s Italians—the only corps which can be said to
have done any serious fighting<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p.
68]</span> Marshal’s strategical combination would have been successful
almost without bloodshed, if only Palombini had not pressed his attack
so hard, and with so little necessity. But the Spanish army, which
was drawn out on a long front of nine miles, without any appreciable
central reserve, and with no protection for its exposed flank, was
doomed to ruin the moment that the enemy appeared in overwhelming
force, beyond and behind its extreme left wing. Blake’s only chance
was to have watched every ford with great vigilance, and to have had a
strong flying column of his best troops ready in some central position,
from which it could be moved out to dispute Suchet’s passage without
a moment’s delay. Far from doing this, he tied down his two veteran
divisions to the defence of the strongest part of his lines, watched
the fords with nothing but cavalry vedettes, and kept no central
reserve at all, save 2,000 or 3,000 men of his untrustworthy ‘Reserve
Division.’ In face of these dispositions the French were almost bound
to be successful. A disaster was inevitable, but Blake might have
made it somewhat less ruinous if he had recognized his real position
promptly, and had ordered a general retreat, when Harispe’s successful
turning movement became evident. In this case he would have lost
Valencia, but not his army.</p>

<p>As it was, a week more saw the miserable end of the campaign.
Suchet’s first precaution was to ascertain whether there was any danger
from the fraction of the Spanish army which Mahy and Obispo had carried
off. He was uncertain how strong they were, and whether they were
prepared to attack him in the rear, supposing that he should sit down
to the siege of Valencia. Accordingly he sent out at dawn on the 26th
December two light columns of cavalry and voltigeurs against Alcira
and Cullera, whither he knew that the refugees had retired. These two
reconnaissances in force discovered the enemy in position, but the
moment that they were descried Mahy retreated towards Alcoy, and Obispo
towards Alicante—both in such haste and disorder that it was evident
that they had no fighting spirit left in them.</p>

<p>Suchet, therefore, was soon relieved of any fear of danger from
this side, and could make his arrangements for the siege. He sent back
to the north bank of the Guadalaviar the whole<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span> division of Musnier, which was there joined
three days later by Reille’s belated brigade, that of Pannetier.
Harispe, Habert, Severoli, and Reille’s other French brigade (that
of Bourke) formed the investment on the southern bank. Palombini lay
astride of the river near Mislata, with one brigade on each bank.
The whole force of 33,000 men was sufficient for the task before it.
The decisive blow would have to be given by the siege artillery; the
whole train which had captured Saguntum had long been ready for its
work. And it had before it not regular fortifications of modern type,
but, in part of the circumference of Blake’s position, mediaeval
walls not built to resist artillery, in the rest the ditch and bank
of the entrenched camp, which, though strong as a field-work, could
not be considered capable of resisting a formal attack by a strong
siege-train.</p>

<p>Blake was as well aware of this as Suchet, and he also knew (what
Suchet could not) that the population of 100,000 souls under his charge
had only 10 days’ provision of flour and 19 or 20 of rice and salt
fish. The city, like the army, had been living on daily convoys from
the south, and had no great central reserves of food. If he should sit
down, like Palafox at Saragossa, to make an obstinate defence behind
improvised works, he would be on the edge of starvation in less than
three weeks. But such a defence was impossible in face of the spirit
of the people, who looked upon Blake as the author of all their woes,
regarded him as a tyrant as well as an imbecile, and were as likely to
rise against him as to turn their energies to resisting the French.
Palafox at Saragossa accomplished what he did because the spirit of the
citizens was with him: Blake was despised as well as detested.</p>

<p>When he recovered his composure he called a council of war, which
voted almost unanimously<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a> that the city was indefensible, and that the
army must try to cut its way out on the north side of the Guadalaviar.
If the sally had been made on the 27th it might have succeeded, for
it was not till late on that day that Suchet’s arrangements for the
blockade of the north bank were complete. But the investing line had
been linked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>
by the night of the 28th-29th, when Blake made his last stroke for
safety. At six in the evening the field army issued from the gate of
St. José and began to cross the bridge opposite it, the westernmost of
the three of which the Spaniards were in possession. This led not to
the great <i>chaussée</i> to Saguntum and Tortosa, which was known to have
been cut and entrenched by the enemy, but to the by-road to Liria and
the mountains. Lardizabal headed the march, Zayas followed, escorting
the artillery and a considerable train, Miranda brought up the rear.
Charles O’Donnell was left to man the walls with the urban guards and
the ‘Reserve Division,’ and was given permission to capitulate whenever
he should be attacked.</p>

<p>Lardizabal’s vanguard, under a Colonel Michelena, swerved from the
Liria road soon after passing the Guadalaviar, in order to avoid French
posts, and successfully got as far as the canal of Mestalla before it
was discovered or checked. The canal was too broad to be passed by
means of some beams and planks which had been brought up. But Michelena
got his men across, partly by fording and partly over a mill-dam, and
presently got to the village of Burjasort, where the artillery of
Palombini’s division were quartered. These troops, surprised in the
dark, could not stop him, and he pushed on through them and escaped
to the hills with his little force—one squadron, one battalion, and
some companies of Cazadores—some 500 or 600 men<a id="FNanchor_59"
href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. Lardizabal, who should
have followed him without delay, halted at the canal, trying to build a
bridge, till the French all along the line were alarmed by the firing
at Burjasort and began to press in upon him. He opened fire instead
of pushing on at all costs, and presently found himself opposed by
forces of growing strength. Blake thereupon made up his mind that the
sally had failed, and gave orders for the whole column to turn back
and re-enter Valencia. It seems probable that at least a great part of
the army might have got away, if an attempt had been made to push on
in Michelena’s wake, for the blockading line was thin here, and only
one French regiment seems to have been engaged in checking Lardizabal’s
exit.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span></p>
<p>Be this as it may, the sortie had failed, and Blake was faced by
complete ruin, being driven back with a disheartened army into a city
incapable of defence against a regular siege, and short of provisions.
Next morning the despair of the garrison was shown by the arrival of
many deserters in the French camp. The inevitable end was delayed for
only eleven days more. On January 1, most of the siege-guns having
been brought across the Guadalaviar, Suchet opened trenches against
two fronts of the entrenched camp, the fort of Monte Oliveto and the
southern point of the suburb of San Vincente, both salient angles
capable of being battered from both flanks. Seven batteries were built
opposite them by January 4th, and the advanced works in front were
pushed up to within fifty yards of the Spanish works. Thereupon Blake,
before the siege-guns had actually opened, abandoned the whole of his
entrenched camp on the next day, without any attempt at defence. The
French discovering the evacuation, entered, and found eighty-one guns
spiked in the batteries, and a considerable quantity of munitions.</p>

<p>Blake was now shut up in the narrow space of the city, whose walls
were very unsuited for defence, and were easily approachable in many
places under shelter of houses left undemolished, which gave cover only
fifty yards from the ramparts. For no attempt had been made to clear
a free space round the inner <i>enceinte</i>, in case the outer circuit of
the camp should be lost. While fresh batteries were being built in
the newly-captured ground, to breach the city wall, Suchet set all
the mortars in his original works to throw bombs into Valencia. He
gathered that the population was demoralized and probably the garrison
also, and thought that a general bombardment of the place might bring
about a surrender without further trouble. About a thousand shells
were dropped into the city within twenty-four hours, and Suchet then
(January 6th) sent a <i>parlementaire</i> to invite Blake to capitulate.
The Captain-General replied magniloquently that ‘although yesterday
morning he might have consented to treat for terms allowing his army
to quit Valencia, in order to spare the inhabitants the horrors of
a bombardment, now, after a day’s firing, he had learnt that he
could rely on the magnanimity and resignation of the people.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> The Marshal might continue
his operations if he pleased, and would bear the responsibility for so
maltreating the place.’</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the bombardment had been very effective,
numerous non-combatants had perished, and the spirit of the population
was broken. Many openly pressed for a surrender, and only a few
fanatical monks went round the streets exhorting the citizens to
resistance. The bombardment continued on the 7th and 8th, and at the
same time Suchet pushed approaches close to the walls, and in several
places set his miners to work to tunnel under them. Actual assault
was never necessary, for on the 8th Blake held a council of war,
which voted for entering into negotiation with the enemy. The report
of this meeting sets forth that ‘it had taken into consideration the
sufferings of the people under these days of bombardment; the cry
of the populace was that an end must be put to its misery; it was
impossible to prolong the defence with any profit, without exposing
the city to the horrors of an assault, in which the besiegers would
probably succeed, considering the depressed condition of the garrison,
and the feebleness of the walls. The citizens had not only failed to
aid in the defence and to second the efforts of the regular troops,
but were panic-stricken and demanded a surrender. The army itself
did not seem disposed to do its duty, and after hearing the evidence
of the commanders of different corps, the council decided in favour
of negotiating to get honourable terms. If these were refused it
might be necessary to continue a hopeless defence and die honourably
among the ruins of Valencia<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>It is probable that Blake would really have accepted any terms
offered him as ‘honourable,’ for he assented to all that Suchet
dictated to him. A feeble attempt to stipulate for a free departure
for the field army, on condition that the city and all its armaments
and resources were handed over intact, met with the curt refusal
that it deserved. A simple capitulation with the honours of war was
granted: one clause, however, was looked upon by Blake as somewhat of
a concession, though it really was entirely to Suchet’s benefit. He
offered to grant an exchange to so many of the garrison as should be
equivalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span> man for
man, to French prisoners from the dépôts in Majorca and Cabrera, where
the unfortunate remnants of Dupont’s army were still in confinement.
As this was not conceded by the Spanish government, the clause had no
real effect in mitigating the fate of Blake’s army<a id="FNanchor_61"
href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. Other clauses in the
capitulation declared that private property should be respected, and
that no inquiry should be made after the surrender into the past
conduct of persons who had taken an active part in the revolution of
1808, or the subsequent defence of the kingdom of Valencia: also that
such civilians as chose might have three months in which to transport
themselves, their families, and their goods to such destination as they
pleased. These clauses, as we shall see, were violated by Suchet with
the most shocking callousness and shameless want of respect for his
written word.</p>

<p>On January 9 the citadel and the gate adjacent were handed over
to the French; Blake (at his own request) was sent away straight to
France, and did not remain to take part in the formal surrender of
his troops and of the city. It would seem that he could not face the
rage of the Valencians, and was only anxious to avoid even twenty-four
hours of sojourn among them after the disaster. Napoleon affected to
regard him as a traitor, though he had never done even a moment’s
homage to Joseph Bonaparte in 1808, and shut him up in close captivity
in the donjon of Vincennes, where he remained very uncomfortably
lodged till the events of April 1814 set him free<a id="FNanchor_62"
href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>The total number of prisoners yielded up by Valencia was
16,270 regular troops, of whom some 1,500 were sick or wounded
in the hospitals. The urban guards and armed peasants, who<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> were supposed to be
civilians covered by the amnesty article in the capitulation, are not
counted in the total. The regulars marched out of the Serranos gate
on January 10, and after laying down their arms and colours were sent
prisoners to France, marching in two columns, under the escort of
Pannetier’s brigade, to Saragossa. Twenty-one colours and no less than
374 cannon (mostly heavy guns in the defences) were given over, as
also a very large store of ammunition and military effects, but very
little food, which was already beginning to fail in the city when Blake
surrendered.</p>

<p>To prevent unlicensed plunder Suchet did not allow his own troops
to enter Valencia till January 14th, giving the civil authorities four
days in which to make preparations for the coming in of the new régime.
He was better received than might have been expected—apparently Blake’s
maladroit dictatorship had thoroughly disgusted the people. Many of
the magistrates bowed to the conqueror and took the oath of homage to
King Joseph, and the aged archbishop emerged from the village where he
had hidden himself for some time, and ‘showed himself animated by an
excellent spirit’ according to the Marshal’s dispatch.</p>

<p>This prompt and tame submission did not save Valencia from dreadful
treatment at the victor’s hands. Not only did he levy on the city and
district a vast fine of 53,000,000 francs (over £2,120,000), of which
3,000,000 were sent to Madrid and the rest devoted to the profit of the
Army of Aragon, but he proceeded to carry out a series of atrocities,
which have been so little spoken of by historians that it would be
difficult to credit them, if they were not avowed with pride in his own
dispatches to Berthier and Napoleon.</p>

<p>The second article of Blake’s capitulation, already cited above,
had granted a complete amnesty for past actions on the part of the
Valencians—’Il ne sera fait aucune recherche pour le passé contre ceux
qui auraient pris une part active à la guerre ou à la révolution,’
to quote the exact term. In his dispatch of January 12 to Berthier,
Suchet is shameless enough to write: ‘I have disarmed the local
militia: all guilty chiefs will be arrested, and all assassins
punished; <i>for in consenting to Article II of the Capitulation my
only aim was to get the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p.
75]</span> over quickly</i><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.’ ‘Guilty chiefs’ turned out to mean all
civilians who had taken a prominent part in the defence of Valencia:
‘assassins’ was interpreted to cover guerrilleros of all sorts, not (as
might perhaps have been expected) merely those persons who had taken
part in the bloody riots against the French commercial community in
1808<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.
In his second dispatch of January 17 Suchet proceeds to explain that
he has arrested 480 persons as ‘suspects,’ that a large number of
guerrillero leaders have been found among them, who have been sent to
the citadel and have been already shot, or will be in a few days. He
has also arrested every monk in Valencia; 500 have been sent prisoners
to France: five of the most guilty, convicted of having carried round
the streets a so-called ‘banner of the faith,’ and of having preached
against capitulation, and excited the people to resistance, have been
already executed. Inquiries were still in progress. They resulted in
the shooting of two more friars<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65"
class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. But the most astonishing clause in the
dispatch is that ‘all those who took part in the murders of the French
[in 1808] will be sought out and punished. Already <i>six hundred</i> have
been executed by the firmness of the Spanish judge Marescot, whom
I am expecting soon to meet<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.’ It was a trifling addition to the catalogue
of Suchet’s doings that 350 students of the university, who had
volunteered to aid the regular artillery during the late siege, had all
been arrested and sent off to France like the monks. Two hundred sick
or footsore prisoners who straggled from the marching column directed
on Teruel and Saragossa are said to have been shot by the wayside<a
id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. It is
probable that innumerable prisoners were put to death in cold blood
after the capitulation of Valencia, in spite of Suchet’s guarantee that
‘no research should be made as to the past.’ Of this Napier says no
word<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,
though he quotes other parts of Suchet’s dispatches, and praises him
for his ‘vigorous and prudent’ conduct, and his ‘care not to offend
the citizens by violating their customs or shocking their religious
feelings.’</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER IV">SECTION XXX: CHAPTER IV</h3>
  <p class="subh3">SUCHET’S CONQUEST OF VALENCIA: SIDE-ISSUES
    AND&nbsp;CONSEQUENCES. JANUARY-MARCH 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> once Suchet’s long-deferred
movements began, on December 26, 1812, his operations were so rapid
and successful that the whole campaign was finished in fourteen days.
The unexpected swiftness of his triumph had the result of rendering
unnecessary the subsidiary operations which Napoleon had directed the
Armies of Portugal, the Centre, and Andalusia, to carry out.</p>

<p>D’Armagnac, with his 3,000 men of the Army of the Centre, still
lay at Cuenca when Suchet’s advance began, hindered from further
movement by the badness of the roads and the weather. Opposite him
were lying Bassecourt’s small force at Requeña—not 2,000 men—and the
larger detachment of the Murcian army under Freire, which Blake had
originally intended to draw down to join his main body. This seems to
have consisted of some 4,000 foot and 1,000 horse<a id="FNanchor_69"
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> about the time of the New
Year.</p>

<p>Far more important was the force under Montbrun, detached from
the Army of Portugal, which had moved (all too tardily) from La
Mancha and the banks of the Tagus, by Napoleon’s orders. Assembled,
as we have already shown<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, only on December 29th, it had started from
San Clemente on January 2 to march against Blake’s rear by the route
of Almanza, the only one practicable for artillery at midwinter.
Thus the expedition was only just getting under way when Suchet had
already beaten Blake and thrust him into Valencia. It consisted of the
infantry divisions of Foy and Sarrut, of the whole of the light cavalry
of the Army of Portugal, and of five batteries<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span> of artillery, in all about 10,000 men. Of
the succour which had been promised from d’Armagnac’s division, to
raise the force to the figures of 12,000 men, few if any came to hand<a
id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p>Montbrun marched with Sarrut and the cavalry by Albacete and
Chinchilla, leaving Foy as a reserve échelon, to follow by slower
stages and keep up the communication with La Mancha. Between Chinchilla
and Almanza the advanced cavalry fell in with Freire’s Spanish
division, marching across its front. For on the news of Suchet’s
passage of the Guadalaviar on December 26, Freire had moved southward
from his position on the Cabriel river, with the intention of joining
Mahy, and so of building up a force strong enough to do something to
succour Blake and the beleaguered garrison of Valencia. On January 6th
Montbrun’s horse came upon one of Freire’s detachments, dispersed it,
and took some prisoners. But the greater part of the Murcians succeeded
in getting past, and in reaching Mahy at Alicante (January 9th).</p>

<p>So cowed was the country-side by the disasters about Valencia that
Montbrun at Almanza succeeded in getting a letter carried by one of his
staff to Valencia in two days<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. It announced to Suchet his arrival on the
rear of the Spanish army, and his intention of pressing on eastward
so as to drive away Freire and Mahy and completely cut off the
retreat of Blake towards Murcia. But when the dispatch was received
Blake was already a prisoner, and his army had laid down its arms on
the preceding day. Suchet, therefore, wrote a reply to Montbrun to
thank him for his co-operation, to inform him that it was no longer
necessary, and to advise him to return as quickly as possible toward
the Army of Portugal and the Tagus, where his presence was now much
more needed than on the coast of the Mediterranean. The Army of Aragon
was strong enough to deal in due course with Mahy and Freire, and to
take Alicante.</p>

<p>Montbrun, however, refused to accept this advice. He was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span> probably, as his chief
Marmont remarks, desirous of distinguishing himself by carrying
out some brilliant enterprise as an independent commander<a
id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Knowing
that Mahy’s and Freire’s troops were in a very demoralized condition,
and underrating the strength of the fortress of Alicante, he resolved
to march against that place, which he thought would make little or
no resistance. Accordingly he called forward Foy to Albacete and
Chinchilla, left the main part of his guns in his charge, and marched
on Alicante with the cavalry and Sarrut’s division, having only one
battery of horse artillery with him.</p>

<p>At the news of his approach Mahy, who had been at Alcoy since
he abandoned the line of the Nucar on December 27th, retired into
Alicante with Creagh’s and Obispo’s infantry. Bassecourt also joined
him there, while Freire with his own column, Villacampa’s division,
and all the Murcian and Valencian cavalry, occupied Elche and other
places in the neighbourhood. Over 6,000 regular infantry were within
the walls of Alicante by January 15th. Montbrun on the following day
drove Freire out of Elche westward, and presented himself in front
of the new fortification of Alicante, which had been much improved
during the last year, and included a new line of bastioned wall
outside the old mediaeval <i>enceinte</i> and the rocky citadel. It is
probable that Montbrun had no knowledge of the recent improvements
to the fortress, and relied on old reports of its weakness. After
advancing into the suburbs, and throwing a few useless shells into
the place, whose artillery returned a heavy fire, he retreated by
Elche and Hellin to Albacete<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. As he went he laid waste the country-side
in the most reckless fashion, and raised heavy requisitions of money
in Elche, Hellin, and other places. This involved him in an angry
correspondence with Suchet, who insisted that no commander but himself
had a right to extort contributions in the region that fell into his
sphere of operations.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p.
79]</span></p> <p>Montbrun’s raid was clearly a misguided operation.
Alicante was far too strong to be taken by escalade, when it was
properly garrisoned: the only chance was that the garrison might
flinch. They refused to do so, and the French general was left in an
absurd position, demonstrating without siege-guns against a regular
fortress. His action had two ill-effects—the first was that it
concluded the Valencian campaign with a fiasco—a definite repulse
which put heart into the Spaniards. The second (and more important)
was that it separated him from Marmont and the Army of Portugal for
ten days longer than was necessary. His chief had given him orders to
be back on the Tagus by the 15th-20th of January, as his absence left
the main body too weak. Owing to his late start he would in any case
have overpassed these dates, even if he had started back from Almanza
on January 13th, after receiving the news of the fall of Valencia.
But by devoting nine days to an advance from Almanza to Alicante and
then a retreat from Alicante to Albacete, he deferred his return to
Castile by that space of time. He only reached Toledo on January 31st
with his main column. Foy’s division, sent on ahead, arrived there
on the 29th. Montbrun’s last marches were executed with wild speed,
for he had received on the way letters of the most alarming kind
from Marmont, informing him that Wellington had crossed the Agueda
with his whole army and laid siege to Ciudad Rodrigo. The Army of
Portugal must concentrate without delay. But by the time that Montbrun
reached Toledo, Rodrigo had already been twelve days in the hands of
the British general, and further haste was useless. The troops were
absolutely worn out, and received with relief the order to halt and
wait further directions, since they were too late to save the fallen
fortress. It is fair to Montbrun to remark that, even if he had never
made his raid on Alicante, he would still have been unable to help
his chief. If he had turned back from Almanza on January 13th, he
would have been at Toledo only on the 22nd—and that city is nearly 200
miles by road from Ciudad Rodrigo, which had fallen on the 19th. The
disaster on the Agueda was attributable not to Montbrun’s presumptuous
action, but to the Emperor’s orders that the Army of Portugal should
make a great detachment for the Valencian<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span> campaign. Even if the raiding column had
started earlier, as Napoleon intended, it could not have turned back
till it got news of the capitulation of Blake, which only took place
on January 8th. And whatever might then have been its exact position,
it could not have been back in time to join Marmont in checking the
operations of Wellington, which (as we have already stated) came to a
successful end on January 19th. Wherefore, though Montbrun must receive
blame, the responsibility for the fall of Rodrigo lay neither with him
nor with Marmont, but with their great master.</p>

<p>Another diversion made by Napoleon’s orders for the purpose of
aiding Suchet was quite as futile—though less from the fault of the
original direction, and more from an unforeseen set of circumstances.
Like Marmont and King Joseph, Soult had also been ordered to lend
Suchet assistance against Valencia, by demonstrating from the side of
Granada against Murcia and its army. This order, issued apparently
about November 19, 1811<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. and repeated on December 6th, reached
the Duke of Dalmatia just when he had assembled all his disposable
field-forces for the siege of Tarifa, an operation where preparations
began on December 8th and which did not end till January 5th.
Having concentrated 13,000 men in the extreme southern point of his
viceroyalty, Soult had not a battalion to spare for a sally from its
extreme eastern point. He could not give up a great enterprise already
begun; and it was only when it had failed, and the troops from Tarifa
were returning—in a sufficiently melancholy plight—that Soult could
do anything. But by this time it was too late to help Suchet, who had
finished his business without requiring assistance from without.</p>

<p class="mt1">Whether Soult was already aware of the surrender
of Valencia or not, when January 20th had arrived, he had before
that day issued orders to his brother, the cavalry general, Pierre
Soult, to take the light horse of the 4th Corps from Granada, and to
execute with them a raid against Murcia, with the object of drawing
off the attention of any Spanish troops left in that direction from
Suchet. The General, with about 800 sabres,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> pushing on by Velez Rubio and Lorca,
arrived before the gates of Murcia quite unopposed on January 25th.
Freire had left no troops whatever to watch the borders of Granada,
and had drawn off everything, save the garrison of Cartagena, toward
the Valencian frontiers. Pierre Soult summoned the defenceless city,
received its surrender, and imposed on it a ransom of 60,000 dollars.
He entered next day, and established himself in the archbishop’s
palace; having neither met nor heard of any enemy he was quite at
his ease, and was sitting down to dine, when a wild rush of Spanish
cavalry came sweeping down the street and cutting up his dispersed and
dismounted troopers. This was General Martin La Carrera, whose brigade
was the nearest force to Murcia when Soult arrived. Hearing that
the French were guarding themselves ill, he had resolved to attempt
a surprise, and, dividing his 800 men into three columns, assailed
Murcia by three different gates. His own detachment cut its way in
with success, did much damage, and nearly captured the French general.
But neither of the other parties showed such resolution; they got
bickering with the French at the entries of the city, failed to push
home, and finally retired with small loss. The gallant and unfortunate
La Carrera, charging up and down the streets in vain search for his
reinforcements, was finally surrounded by superior numbers, and died
fighting gallantly.</p>

<p>His enterprise warned Soult that Spanish troops were collecting
in front of him, and indeed Villacampa’s infantry was not far off.
Wherefore he evacuated Murcia next day, after raising so much of the
contribution as he could, and plundering many private houses. The
Spaniards reoccupied the place, and Joseph O’Donnell, now placed in
command of the Murcian army in succession to Mahy, gave La Carrera’s
corpse a splendid funeral. Soult retreated hastily to the Granadan
frontier, pillaging Alcantarilla and Lorca by the way. This was the
only part taken by the French Army of Andalusia in the January campaign
of 1812. The siege of Tarifa had absorbed all its energies.</p>

<p>Montbrun’s and Pierre Soult’s enterprises had little effect on
the general course of events in eastern Spain. It was Suchet’s own
operations which, in the estimation of every observer from the Emperor
downwards, were to be considered decisive.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> When Valencia had fallen, every one on the
French side supposed that the war was practically at an end in this
region, and that the dispersion of the remnants of Mahy’s and Freire’s
troops and the capture of Peniscola, Alicante, and Cartagena,—the three
fortresses still in Spanish hands,—were mere matters of detail. No one
could have foreseen that the region south of the Xucar was destined
to remain permanently in the hands of the patriots, and that Suchet’s
occupation of Valencia was to last for no more than eighteen months.
Two causes, neither of them depending on Suchet’s own responsibility,
were destined to save the kingdom of Murcia and the southern region of
Valencia from conquest. The first was Napoleon’s redistribution of his
troops in eastern Spain, consequent on the approach of his war with
Russia. The second was the sudden victorious onslaught of Wellington
on the French in the western parts of the Peninsula. How the former
of these causes worked must at once be shown—the effect of the latter
cause did not become evident till a little later.</p>

<p>Of the 33,000 men with whom Suchet had conquered Valencia and
captured Blake, no less than 13,000 under Reille had been lent him from
the Army of the North, and were under orders to return to the Ebro
as soon as possible. Indeed, till they should get back, Aragon, very
insufficiently garrisoned by Caffarelli’s division, was out of hand,
and almost as much in the power of the Empecinado, Duran, and Montijo,
as of the French. Moreover, so long as Caffarelli was at Saragossa,
and his troops dispersed in the surrounding region, both Navarre and
Old Castile were undermanned, and the Army of the North was reduced to
little more than Dorsenne’s two divisions of the Young Guard. To secure
the troops for the great push against Valencia, so many divisions
had shifted eastward, that Marmont and Dorsenne between them had, as
the Emperor must have seen, barely troops enough in hand to maintain
their position, if Wellington should make some unexpected move—though
Napoleon had persuaded himself that such a move was improbable. In
spite of this, he was anxious to draw back Reille’s and Caffarelli’s,
no less than Montbrun’s, men to more central positions.</p>

<p>But this was not all: in December the Emperor’s dispatches<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> begin to show that he
regarded war with Russia in the spring of 1812 as decidedly probable,
and that for this reason he was about to withdraw all the Imperial
Guard from Spain. On December 15th a note to Berthier ordered all
the light and heavy cavalry of the Guard—chasseurs, grenadiers à
cheval, dragoons, Polish lancers—to be brought home, as also its horse
artillery and the <i>gendarmes d’élite</i>. All these were serving in the
Army of the North, and formed the best part of its mounted troops. This
was but a trifling preliminary warning of his intentions: on January
14, 1812—the results of the Valencian campaign being still unknown—he
directed Berthier to withdraw from Spain the whole of the Infantry of
the Guard and the whole of the Polish regiments in Spain. This was
an order of wide-spreading importance, and created large gaps in the
muster-rolls of Suchet, Soult, and Dorsenne. Suchet’s Poles (three
regiments of the Legion of the Vistula, nearly 6,000 men, including
the detachments left in Aragon) formed a most important part of the
3rd Corps. Soult had the 4th, 6th, and 9th Polish regiments and the
Lancers, who had done such good service at Albuera, a total of another
6,000 men. But Dorsenne was to be the greatest sufferer—he had in the
Army of the North not only the 4th of the Vistula, some 1,500 bayonets,
but the whole of the infantry of the Young Guard, the two divisions
of Roguet and Dumoustier, twenty-two battalions over 14,000 strong.
The dispatch of January 14 directed that Suchet should send off his
battalions of the Legion ‘immediately after the fall of Valencia.’
Soult was to draft away his Poles ‘within twenty-four hours after the
receipt of the order.’ Dorsenne, of course, could not begin to send off
the Guard Divisions of infantry till the troops lent from the Army of
the North (Reille and Caffarelli) were freed from the duties imposed
on them by the Valencian expedition. A supplementary order of January
27th told him that he might keep them for some time longer if the
English took the offensive—news of Wellington’s march on Rodrigo was
just coming to hand. ‘Le désir,’ says the Emperor, ‘que j’ai d’avoir
ma Garde n’est pas tellement pressant qu’il faille la renvoyer avant
que les affaires aient pris une situation nouvelle dans le Nord<a
id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>’ As a matter of fact some
Guard-brigades did not get off till March, though by dint of rapid
transport, when they had once passed the Pyrenees, they struggled
to the front in time to take part in the opening of the great
Russian campaign in June. The fourth brigade, eight battalions under
Dumoustier, did not get away till the autumn was over.</p>

<p>Thus the Emperor had marked off about 27,000 good veteran troops for
removal from the Peninsula, with the intention of using them in the
oncoming Russian war. The Army of the North was to lose the best of
its divisions—those of the South and of Aragon very heavy detachments.
Nothing was to come in return, save a few drafts and <i>bataillons de
marche</i> which were lying at Bayonne. The Emperor in his dispatch makes
some curious self-justificatory remarks, to the effect that he should
leave the Army of Spain stronger than it had been in the summer of
1811; for while he was withdrawing thirty-six battalions, he had sent
into the Peninsula, since June last, forty-two battalions under Reille,
Caffarelli, and Severoli. This was true enough: but if the total
strength of the troops now dedicated to Spain was not less than it had
been in June 1811, it was left weaker by 27,000 men than it had been in
December 1811.</p>

<p>Now Suchet, when deprived of Reille’s aid, and at the same time
directed to send back to France his six Polish battalions, was left
with a very inadequate force in Valencia—not much more than half what
he had at his disposition on January 1. It would seem that the Emperor
overrated the effect of the capture of Blake and the destruction of his
army. At any rate, in his dispatches to Suchet, he seemed to consider
that the whole business in the East was practically completed by the
triumph at the New Year. The Marshal was directed ‘to push an advanced
guard towards Murcia, and put himself in communication with the 4th
Corps—the eastern wing of Soult’s army—which would be found at Lorca<a
id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.’ But
the operations of the troops of the Army of Andalusia in this quarter
were limited to the appearance for two days at Murcia of Pierre
Soult’s small cavalry raid, of which Suchet got no news till it was
passed and gone. He was left entirely to his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> own resources, and these were too small
for any further advance: the Emperor not only took away both Reille
and the Poles, but sent, a few days later, orders that Palombini’s
Italian division, reduced by now to 3,000 men by its heavy casualties
on December 26th, should be sent into southern Aragon against Duran and
Montijo. The departure of Palombini (February 15th) left Suchet with
less than 15,000 men in hand. It must be remembered that the conquest
of a Spanish province always meant, for the French, the setting aside
of a large immobilized garrison, to hold it down, unless it were to
be permitted to drop back into insurrection. It was clear that with
the bulk of the kingdom of Valencia to garrison, not to speak of the
siege of the still intact fortress of Peniscola, Suchet would have an
infinitesimal field-force left for the final move that would be needed,
if Mahy and Freire were to be crushed, and Alicante and Cartagena—both
strong places—to be beleaguered.</p>

<p>The Marshal had by the last week in January pushed Harispe’s
division to Xativa, beyond the Xucar, and Habert’s to Gandia near the
sea-coast. These 9,000 men were all his disposable force for a further
advance: Valencia had to be garrisoned; Musnier’s division had gone
north, to cover the high-road as far as Tortosa and the Ebro; some of
the Italians were sent to besiege Peniscola. Suchet might, no doubt,
have pushed Habert and Harispe further forward towards Alicante, but
he had many reasons for not doing so. That fortress had been proved—by
Montbrun’s raid—to be in a posture of defence: besides its garrison
there were other Spanish troops in arms in the neighbourhood. To the
forces of Freire, Obispo, Villacampa, and Bassecourt, there was added
the newly-formed brigade of General Roche, an Irish officer lent
by the British government to the Spaniards, who had been drilling
and disciplining the cadres of the battalions handed over to him<a
id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, till
they were in a better condition than most of the other troops on
this coast. The muster-rolls of the ‘united 2nd and 3rd armies,’ as
these remnants were now officially styled, showed, on February 1,
1812, 14,000 men present, not including Villacampa’s division,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> which was moving off to
its old haunts in Aragon. By March 1 this figure had risen to 18,000,
many deserters who had gone home after the fall of Valencia having
tardily rejoined the ranks of their battalions. Over 2,000 cavalry were
included in the total—for nearly the whole of Blake’s squadrons had
escaped (not too gloriously) after the disastrous combats on December
26, 1812.</p>

<p>If Suchet, therefore, had moved forward with a few thousand men at
the end of January, he would have risked something, despite of the
depressed morale of his enemies. But in addition there was vexatious
news from Catalonia, which presently caused the sending of part of
Musnier’s division beyond the Ebro, and it was reported (only too
correctly) that the yellow fever had broken out with renewed violence
at Murcia and Cartagena. An advance into the infected district might
be hazardous. But most of all was any further initiative discouraged
by the consideration that no help could be expected from Marmont or
Soult. By the end of January Suchet was aware of Wellington’s invasion
of Leon, and of the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. Not only did this move
absorb all the attention of Marmont, Dorsenne, and King Joseph, but
Soult was convinced that it boded evil for him also, and that a new
attack on Badajoz was imminent. Hill’s manœuvres in Estremadura (of
which more elsewhere) attracted all his attention, and he let it be
known that he had neither the wish nor the power to send expeditions
eastward, to co-operate against Murcia. Last, but most conclusive, of
all Suchet’s hindrances was a grave attack of illness, which threw
him on a bed of sickness early in February, and caused him to solicit
permission to return to France for his convalescence. The Emperor
(with many flattering words) refused this leave, and sent two of his
body physicians to Valencia to treat the Marshal’s ailment. But it was
two months before Suchet was able to mount his horse, and put himself
at the head of his army. From February to the beginning of April
operations were necessarily suspended for the Army of Aragon, since its
chief was not one of those who gladly hand over responsibility and the
power of initiative to his subordinates.</p>

<p>Hence there was a long gap in the story of the war in south<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>-eastern Spain from January
to April 1812. The only events requiring notice during that period were
the occupation by the French of Denia and Peniscola. The former, a
little port on the projecting headland south of Valencia, was furnished
with fortifications newly repaired during Blake’s régime, and had been
an important centre of distribution for stores and munitions of war,
after the Spaniards lost the Grao of Valencia in November, since it
was the nearest harbour to their positions along the Guadalaviar. In
the general panic after Blake’s surrender Mahy withdrew its garrison,
but forgot to order the removal of its magazines. Harispe seized Denia
on January 20, and found sixty guns mounted on its walls, and forty
small merchant vessels, some of them laden with stores, in its port. He
garrisoned the place, and fitted out some of the vessels as privateers.
Mahy’s carelessness in abandoning these resources was one of the
reasons which contributed most to his removal from command by the Cadiz
Regency. It was indeed a gross piece of neglect, for at least the guns
might have been destroyed, and the ships brought round to Alicante.</p>

<p>The story of Peniscola, however, was far more disgraceful. This
fortress sometimes called ‘the little Gibraltar’ from its impregnable
situation—it is a towering rock connected with the mainland by a narrow
sand-spit 250 yards long—was one of the strongest places in all Spain.
It had appeared so impregnable to Suchet, that, on his southward
march from Tortosa to Valencia, he had merely masked it, and made
no attempt to meddle with it<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79"
class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. Peniscola had suffered no molestation, and
was regularly revictualled by Spanish and British coasting vessels
from Alicante, Cartagena, and the Balearic Isles. The governor,
Garcia Navarro, was an officer who had an excellent reputation for
personal courage—taken prisoner at Falset in 1811<a id="FNanchor_80"
href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> he had succeeded in
escaping from a French prison and had reported himself again for
further service. The garrison of 1,000 men was adequate for such a
small place, and was composed of veteran troops. In directing it to be
formally beleaguered after the fall of Valencia, Suchet seems to have
relied more on the general demoralization caused by the annihilation
of Blake’s army than on the strength of his means of attack.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> On January 20th he ordered
Severoli with two Italian and two French battalions to press the place
as far as was possible, and assigned to him part of the siege-train
that had been used at Saguntum. The trenches, on the high ground of the
mainland nearest the place, were opened on the 28th, and on the 31st
the besiegers began to sap downhill towards the isthmus, and to erect
five batteries on the best available points. But it was clear that the
fortress was most inaccessible, and that to reach its walls across the
low-lying sand-spit would be a very costly business.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when a summons was sent in to the governor on February
2nd, he surrendered at once, getting in return terms of an unusually
favourable kind—the men and officers of the garrison were given leave
either to depart to their homes with all their personal property, or
to enlist in the service of King Joseph. This was a piece of mere
treachery: Navarro had made up his mind that the cause of Spain
was ruined by Blake’s disaster, and had resolved to go over to the
enemy, while there were still good terms to be got for deserters. As
Suchet tells the story, the affair went as follows. A small vessel,
sailing from Peniscola to Alicante, was taken by a privateer fitted
out by Harispe at Denia. Among letters seized by the captors<a
id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> was
one from the governor, expressing his disgust with his situation,
and in especial with the peremptory advice given him by the English
naval officers who were in charge of the revictualling service and
the communications. He went on to say that he would rather surrender
Peniscola to the French than let it be treated as a British dependency,
whereupon the Marshal asked, and obtained, the surrender of the place.
Napier expresses a suspicion—probably a well-founded one—that the
letter may have been really intended for Suchet’s own eye, and that
the whole story was a piece of solemn deceit. ‘Such is the Marshal’s
account of the affair—but the colour which he thought it necessary
to give to a transaction so full of shame to Navarro, can only be
considered as part of the price paid for Peniscola<a id="FNanchor_82"
href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.’ The mental attitude
of the traitor is sufficiently expressed by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span> a letter which reached Suchet along with
the capitulation. ‘I followed with zeal, with fury I may say, the
side which I considered the just one. To-day I see that to render
Spain less unhappy it is necessary for us all to unite under the
King, and I make my offer to serve him with the same enthusiasm.
Your excellency may be quite sure of me—I surrender a fortress fully
provisioned and capable of a long defence—which is the best guarantee
of the sincerity of my promise<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.’</p>

<p>The most astounding feature of the capitulation was that Navarro got
his officers to consent to such a piece of open treachery. If they had
done their duty, they would have arrested him, and sent him a prisoner
to Alicante. Demoralization and despair must have gone very far in this
miserable garrison.</p>

<p>The capture of Peniscola was Suchet’s last success. He fell sick
not long after, and when he once more assumed the active command
of his troops in April, the whole situation of French affairs in
Spain was changed, and no further advance was possible. The results
of Wellington’s offensive operations in the West had begun to make
themselves felt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the remains of the Valencian and Murcian armies were
reorganizing themselves, with Alicante as their base and central port
of supply. Joseph O’Donnell, though not a great general, was at least
no worse than Blake and Mahy—of whom the former was certainly the most
maladroit as well as the most unlucky of commanders, while the latter
had shown himself too timid and resourceless to play out the apparently
lost game that was left to his hand in January 1812. By March there was
once more an army in face of the French, and in view of the sudden halt
of the invaders and the cheerful news from the West, hope was once more
permissible. The main body of O’Donnell’s army remained concentrated
in front of Alicante, but Villacampa’s division had gone off early to
Aragon, to aid in the diversion against Suchet’s communications, which
was so constantly kept up by Duran and the Empecinado. This was a good
move: the weak point of the French occupation was the impossibility
of holding down broad mountain spaces, in which small garrisons were
useless and helpless, while heavy columns could not live for more than
a few days on any given spot.</p>

carried in the last volume of this work down to October 28, 1811, when
Marshal Macdonald, like St. Cyr and Augereau, was recalled to Paris,
having added no more to his reputation than had his predecessors while
in charge of this mountainous principality. We have seen how General
Lacy, hoping against hope, rallied the last remnants of the old Catalan
army, and recommenced (just as Macdonald was departing) a series of
small enterprises against the scattered French garrisons. He had won
several petty successes in evicting the enemy from Cervera, Igualada,
and Belpuig—the small strongholds which covered the main line of
communication east and west, through the centre of the land, between
Lerida and Barcelona. The enemy had even been forced to evacuate the
holy mountain of Montserrat, the strongest post on the whole line.</p>

<p>Hence when, in November, General Decaen arrived to take over
Macdonald’s task, he found before him a task not without serious
difficulties, though the actual force of Spaniards in the field was
far less than it had been before the disasters at Tarragona and
Figueras. Lacy had a very small field army—he had reorganized 8,000
men by October, and all through his command the total did not grow
very much greater. When he handed over his office to Copons fifteen
months after, there were no more than 14,000 men under arms, including
cadres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> and recruits.
On the other hand he had a central position, a free range east and
west, now that the line of French posts across Catalonia had been
broken, and several points of more or less safe access to the sea.
Munitions and stores, and occasionally very small reinforcements from
the Balearic Isles, were still brought over by the British squadron
which ranged along the coast. Some of the officers, especially the much
tried and never-despairing Eroles, and the indefatigable Manso, were
thoroughly to be relied upon, and commanded great local popularity.
This Lacy himself did not possess—he was obeyed because of his stern
resolve, but much disliked for his autocratic and dictatorial ways,
which kept him in constant friction with the Junta that sat at Berga.
Moreover he was a stranger, while the Catalans disliked all leaders who
were not of their own blood: and he was strongly convinced that the
brunt of the fighting must be borne by the regular troops, while the
popular voice was all in favour of the <i>somatenes</i> and guerrilleros,
and against the enforcement of conscription. Much was to be said on
either side: the warfare of the irregulars was very harassing to the
French, and had led to many petty successes, and one great one—the
capture of Figueras. On the other hand these levies were irresponsible
and untrustworthy when any definite operation was in hand: they
might, or they might not, turn up in force when they were required:
the frank disregard of their chiefs for punctuality or obedience
drove to wild rage any officer who had served in the old army. With
regular troops it was possible to calculate that a force would be
where it was wanted to be at a given time, and would at least attempt
to carry out its orders: with the <i>somatenes</i> it was always possible,
nay probable, that some petty quarrel of rival chiefs, or some rival
attraction of an unforeseen sort, would lead to non-appearance. To
this there was the easy reply that ever since Blake first tried to
make the Catalans work ‘<i>militarmente</i> and not <i>paisanmente</i>’ the
regular army for some two years had never gained a single battle, nor
relieved a single fortress<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. The best<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> plan would probably have been to attempt
to combine the two systems: it was absolutely necessary to have a
nucleus of regular troops, but unwise to act like Blake and Lacy, who
tried to break up and discourage the <i>somatenes</i>, in order that they
might be forced into the battalions of the standing army. The constant
series of defeats on record had been caused rather by the unskilful
and over-ambitious operations of the generals than by their insisting
on keeping up the regular troops, who had behaved well enough on many
occasions. But too much had been asked of them when, half-trained
and badly led, they were brought into collision with the veterans of
France, without the superiority of numbers which alone could make up
for their military faults.</p>

<p>Since the capture of Cervera, Belpuig, and Igualada in October, the
territories held by the French in Catalonia fell into two separate and
divided sections. On the western side, adjacent to Aragon, Frère’s
division, left behind by Suchet, garrisoned Lerida, Tarragona, and
Tortosa: though it was a powerful force of over 7,000 men, it could
do little more than occupy these three large places, each requiring
several battalions. At the best it could only furnish very small
flying columns to keep up the communication between them. It was hard
to maintain touch with the other group of French fortresses, along
the sea-coast road from Tarragona to Barcelona, which were often
obsessed by Spanish bands, and always liable to be molested by Edward
Codrington’s British ships, which sailed up and down the shore looking
for detachments or convoys to shell. The fort of the Col de Balaguer,
twenty miles north of Tortosa, was the look-out point towards Tarragona
and the sole French outpost in that direction.</p>

<p>In eastern Catalonia the newly-arrived commander, General Decaen (a
veteran whose last work had been the hopeless defence of Bourbon and
Mauritius, where he had capitulated in 1810), had some 24,000 men in
hand. But he was much hampered by the necessity for holding and feeding
the immense Barcelona, a turbulent city which absorbed a whole division
for its garrison. It was constantly on the edge of starvation, and
was only revictualled with great trouble by vessels sailing from the
ports of Languedoc, of which more than half were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> habitually captured by the British, or by
heavy convoys labouring across the hills from Gerona, which were always
harassed, and sometimes taken wholesale, by the Spanish detachments
told off by Lacy for this end. Gerona and Figueras, both fortresses of
considerable size, absorbed several battalions each. Smaller garrisons
had also to be kept in Rosas, Hostalrich, Mataro, and Montlouis, and
there were many other fortified posts which guarded roads or passes,
and were worth holding. It was with difficulty that 6,000 or 8,000
men could be collected for a movable field-force, even by borrowing
detachments from the garrisons. An additional nuisance cropped up just
as Decaen took over the command: Lacy, seeing that the Pyrenean passes
were thinly manned, sent Eroles with 3,000 men to raid the valleys
of Cerdagne on the French side of the hills. The invaders beat two
battalions of national guards near Puigcerda, and swept far down the
valley (October 29-November 2), returning with thousands of sheep and
cattle and a large money contribution levied from the villages. This
raid (which enraged Napoleon<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a>) made it necessary to guard the Pyrenees
better, and to send up more national guards from the frontier
departments.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that though Lacy had no more than 8,000 men
available, and no fortress of any strength to serve as his base
(Cardona and Seu d’Urgel, his sole strongholds, were mediaeval
strongholds with no modern works), he paralysed the French force
which, between Lerida and Figueras, could show more than three times
that strength. Such was the value of the central position, and the
resolute hatred of the countryside for its oppressors. Catalonia
could only be held down by garrisoning every village—and if the army
of occupation split itself up into garrisons it was helpless. Hence,
during the winter of 1811-12 and the spring and summer of the following
year, it may be said that the initiative lay with the Catalans, and
that the enemy (despite of his immensely superior numbers) was on the
defensive. The helplessness of the French was sufficiently shown by
the fact that from June to December 1811 Barcelona was completely cut
off from communication with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p.
94]</span> Gerona and France. It was only in the latter month that
Decaen, hearing that the place was on the edge of starvation, marched
with the bulk of Lamarque’s division from Upper Catalonia to introduce
a convoy; while Maurice Mathieu, the governor of Barcelona, came out
with 3,000 men of the garrison to meet him, as far as Cardadeu. Lacy,
determined that nothing short of a vigorous push by the enemy should
make their junction possible, and relieve Barcelona, offered opposition
in the defile of the Trentapassos, where Vives had tried to stop St.
Cyr two years back, showing a front both to Decaen and to Mathieu.
But on recognizing the very superior numbers of the enemy he wisely
withdrew, or he would have been caught between the two French columns.
Decaen therefore was able to enter Barcelona with his immense convoy.
[December 3rd-4th, 1811.] The Spaniards retreated into the inland;
their headquarters on the first day of the New Year were at Vich.</p>

<p>There being no further profit in pressing Barcelona for the time
being, Lacy, in January, resolved to turn his attention to the much
weaker garrison of Tarragona, which belonged to Frère’s division
and Suchet’s army, and was not under Decaen’s immediate charge. Its
communications with Lerida and Tortosa were hazardous, and its stores
were running low. The Spanish general therefore (about January 2) sent
down Eroles’s division to Reus, a few miles inland from Tarragona, with
orders to cut all the roads leading into that fortress. The place was
already in a parlous condition for want of food, and its governor had
sent representations to Suchet that he was in need of instant succour.
Therefore the moment that Valencia fell, the Marshal directed Musnier,
whose division he had told off to hold the sea-coast between the Ebro
and Guadalaviar, to march with the bulk of his men to Tortosa, to pick
up what reinforcements he could from its garrison, and to open the road
from thence to Tarragona.</p>

<p>Lafosse, the governor of Tortosa, was so impressed with the danger
of his colleague in Tarragona, that he marched ahead along the
coast-road before Musnier arrived, and reached the Col de Balaguer with
a battalion of the 121st regiment and one troop of dragoons on January
18. Here he should have waited for the main column, but receiving
false news that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>
Eroles had left Reus and returned to the north, he resolved to push
on ahead and clear the way for Musnier, believing that nothing but
local <i>somatenes</i> were in front of him. He had reached Villaseca, only
seven miles from Tarragona, when he was suddenly surprised by Eroles
descending on his flank with over 3,000 men. He himself galloped on
with the dragoons towards Tarragona, and escaped, with only twenty-two
men, into the fortress. But his battalion, after barricading itself
in Villaseca village and making a good resistance for some hours, was
forced to surrender. Eroles took nearly 600 prisoners, and over 200
French had fallen. Lafosse, sallying from Tarragona with all that could
be spared from the garrison, arrived too late to help his men, and had
to return in haste [January 19]<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p>Tarragona now seemed in imminent danger, and both Musnier at Tortosa
and Maurice Mathieu at Barcelona saw that they must do their best to
relieve the place, or it would be starved out. Musnier spent so much
time in organizing a convoy that he was late, and the actual opening
of the road was carried out by the governor of Barcelona. That great
city chanced to be crammed with troops at the moment, since Lamarque’s
division, which had escorted the December convoy, was still lying
within its walls. Maurice Mathieu, therefore, was able to collect 8,000
men for the march on Tarragona. Eroles, unfortunately for himself, was
not aware of this, and believing that the enemy was a mere sally of the
Barcelona garrison, offered them battle at Altafulla on January 24. The
French had marched by night, and a fog chanced to prevent the Catalans
from recognizing the strength of the two columns that were approaching
them. Eroles found himself committed to a close fight with double his
own numbers, and after a creditable resistance was routed, losing his
only two guns and the rearguard with which he tried to detain the
enemy. His troops only escaped by breaking up and flying over the
hills, in what a French eye-witness described as <i>un sauve-qui-peut
général</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span> About 600
of them in all were slain or taken: the rest assembled at Igualada
three days later. Eroles blamed Lacy and Sarsfield for his disaster,
asserting that the Captain-General had promised to send the division of
the latter to his help. But his anger appears to have been misplaced,
for at this very time Decaen, to make a division in favour of Maurice
Mathieu’s movement, had sent out two columns from Gerona and Figueras
into Upper Catalonia. They occupied Vich, Lacy’s recent head-quarters,
on January 22, two days before the combat of Altafulla, and Sarsfield’s
troops were naturally sent to oppose them. After wasting the upper
valleys, Decaen drew back to Gerona and Olot on the 29th, having
sufficiently achieved his purpose. Tarragona, meanwhile, was thoroughly
revictualled by Musnier, who brought up a large convoy from Tortosa.
Reinforcements were also thrown into the place, and a new governor,
General Bertoletti, who was to distinguish himself by a spirited
defence in the following year.</p>

<p>In February the whole situation of affairs in Aragon and western
Catalonia (eastern Catalonia was less affected), was much modified by
the return from the south of the numerous troops which had been lent
to Suchet for his Valencian expedition. It will be remembered that
Napoleon had ordered that Reille should march back to the Ebro with his
own and Severoli’s divisions, and that shortly afterwards he directed
that Palombini’s division should follow the other two into Aragon. Thus
a very large body of troops was once more available for the subjection
of Aragon and western Catalonia, which, since Reille’s departure in
December, had been very inadequately garrisoned by Caffarelli’s and
Frère’s battalions, and had been overrun in many districts by the bands
of the Empecinado, Duran, Mina, and the Conde de Montijo. Napoleon’s
new plan was to rearrange the whole of the troops in eastern Spain.</p>

    CATALONIA
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">Reille was to be the chief of a new ‘Army of the Ebro,’
composed of four field divisions—his own, Palombini’s and Severoli’s
Italians, and a new composite one under General Ferino constructed
from so many of Frère’s troops as could be spared from garrison duty
(seven battalions of the 14th and 115th of the line), and six more
battalions (1st Léger and 5th of the line) taken half from Musnier’s
division of Suchet’s army and half from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span> Maurice Mathieu’s Barcelona garrison<a
id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.
This last division never came into existence, as Suchet and Maurice
Mathieu both found themselves too weak to give up the requisitioned
regiments, which remained embodied respectively with the Valencian and
Catalan armies. Nevertheless Reille had more than 20,000 men actually
in hand, not including the fixed garrisons of Tarragona, Lerida, and
the other fortresses on the borders of Aragon and Catalonia. This,
when it is remembered that Caffarelli was still holding the Saragossa
district, seemed an adequate force with which to make an end of the
guerrilleros of Aragon, and then to complete, in conjunction with
Decaen’s Corps, the subjection of inland Catalonia. For this last
operation was to be the final purpose of Reille: while Decaen was to
attack Lacy from the eastern side, Reille (with Lerida as his base)
was to fall on from the west, to occupy Urgel and Berga (the seat of
the Catalan Junta and the centre of organized resistance), and to
join hands with Decaen across the crushed remnants of the Spanish
army<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.
So sure did the Emperor feel that the last elements of Catalan
resistance were now to be destroyed, that he gave orders for the
issue of the proclamation (drawn up long before<a id="FNanchor_89"
href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>) by which the
Principality was declared to be united to the French empire. It was
to be divided into the four departments of the Ter [capital Gerona],
Montserrat [capital Barcelona], Bouches-de-l’Ebre [capital Lerida], and
Segre [capital Puigcerda]. Prefects and other officials were appointed
for each department, and justice was to be administered in the name
of the Emperor. The humour of the arrangement (which its creator most
certainly failed to see) was that three-fourths of the territory of
each department was in the hands of the patriots whom he styled rebels,
and that none of his prefects could have gone ten miles from his
<i>chef-lieu</i> without an escort of 200 men, under pain of captivity or
death.</p>

<p>Reille’s start was much delayed by the fact that one of his
French brigades had been told off to serve as escort to the mass of
Blake’s prisoners from Valencia, and could not get quit of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> them till, marching by
Teruel, it had handed them over for transference beyond the Pyrenees to
the garrison of Saragossa. Of his two Italian divisions, Palombini’s
was instructed to devote itself to the clearing of southern Aragon,
and the opening up of the communications between the French garrisons
of Daroca, Teruel, and Calatayud. The other, Severoli’s, called off
from the siege of Peniscola, which had originally been entrusted to
it<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>,
marched for Lerida in two columns, the one by the sea-coast and
Tortosa, the other inland, by way of Morella and Mequinenza. When his
troops had begun to concentrate on the borders of Aragon and Catalonia,
in and about Lerida, Reille began operations by sending a column, one
French brigade and one Italian regiment, to attack the ubiquitous
Eroles, who, since his defeat at Altafulla a month before, had betaken
himself to the inland, and the rough country along the valleys of the
two Nogueras, with the object of covering Catalonia on its western
front.</p>

<p>This expedition, entrusted to the French brigadier Bourke, ended in
an unexpected check: Eroles offered battle with 3,000 men in a strong
position at Roda, with a torrent bed covering his front (March 5).
Bourke, having far superior numbers, and not aware of the tenacity
of the Catalan troops, whom he had never before encountered, ordered
a general frontal attack by battalions of the 60th French and 7th
Italian line. It was handsomely repulsed, with such heavy loss—600
casualties it is said—that the French retreated as far as Barbastro,
pursued for some distance by the troops of Eroles, who thus showed that
their late disaster had not impaired their morale<a id="FNanchor_91"
href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. This was a most glorious
day for the Baron, one of the few leaders of real capacity whom the
war in Catalonia revealed. He had been a civilian in 1808, and had
to learn the elements of military art under chiefs as incapable as
Blake and Campoverde. From a miquelete chief he rose to be a general
in the regular army, purely by the force of his unconquerable<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span> pertinacity and a courage
which no disasters could break. As a local patriot he had an advantage
in dealing with his Catalan countrymen, which strangers like Reding,
Blake, Lacy, or Sarsfield never possessed, and their confidence was
never betrayed. A little active man of great vivacity, generally with a
cigar in the corner of his mouth, and never long still, he was not only
a good leader of irregular bands, but quite capable of understanding
a strategical move, and of handling a division in a serious action.
His self-abnegation during his service under chiefs whose plans were
often unwise, and whose authority was often exercised in a galling
fashion, was beyond all praise<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>The check at Roda forced Reille to turn aside more troops against
Eroles—practically the whole of Severoli’s division was added to
the column which had just been defeated, and on March 13th such a
force marched against him that he was compelled to retire, drawing
his pursuers after him toward the upper course of the Noguera, and
ultimately to seek refuge in the wilds of Talarn among the foot-hills
of the higher Pyrenees. His operations with a trifling force paralysed
nearly half Reille’s army during two critical months of the spring
of 1812. Meanwhile, covered by his demonstration, Sarsfield executed
a destructive raid across the French border, overran the valleys
beyond Andorra, and exacted a ransom of 70,000 dollars from Foix,
the chief town of the department of the Arriège (February 19). This
was the best possible reply to Napoleon’s recent declaration that
Catalonia had become French soil. The Emperor was naturally enraged;
he reiterated his orders to Reille to ‘déloger les insurgents: il
n’est que trop vrai qu’ils se nourrissent de France’—’il faut mettre
un terme à ces insultes<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.’ But though Reille pushed his marches far
into the remote mountainous districts where the borders of Aragon and
Catalonia meet, he never succeeded in destroying the bands which he
was set to hunt down: a trail of burnt villages marked his course,
but it had no permanent result. The inhabitants descended from the
hills, to reoccupy their fields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p.
100]</span> and rebuild their huts, when he had passed by, and
the insurgents were soon prowling again near the forts of Lerida,
Barbastro, and Monzon.</p>

<p>Palombini in southern Aragon had equally unsatisfactory experiences.
Coming up from Valencia by the high-road, he had reached Teruel on
February 19th, and, after relieving and strengthening the garrison
there, set out on a circular sweep, with the intention of hunting
down Gayan and Duran—the Conde de Montijo had just returned to the
Murcian army at this moment<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, while the Empecinado was out of the game
for some weeks, being, as we shall presently see, busy in New Castile.
But the movements of the Italian general were soon complicated by the
fact that Villacampa, with the remnants of his division, had started
from the neighbourhood of Alicante and Murcia much at the same time as
himself, to seek once more his old haunts in Aragon. This division had
given a very poor account of itself while serving as regular troops
under Blake, but when it returned to its native mountains assumed a
very different efficiency in the character of a large guerrilla band.
Appearing at first only 2,000 strong, it recruited itself up to a much
greater strength from local levies, and became no mean hindrance to
Palombini’s operations.</p>

<p>On the 29th of February the Italian general relieved Daroca, and a
few days later he occupied Calatayud, which had been left ungarrisoned
since the disaster of the previous October<a id="FNanchor_95"
href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. After fortifying the
convent of Nostra Señora de la Peña as a new citadel for this place,
he split up his division into several small columns, which scoured the
neighbourhood, partly to sweep in provisions for the post at Calatayud,
partly to drive off the guerrilleros of the region. But to risk small
detachments in Aragon was always a dangerous business; Villacampa, who
had now come up from the south, cut off one body of 200 men at Campillo
on March 5, and destroyed six companies at Pozohondon on the 28th of
the same month. Taught prudence by these petty disasters, and by some
less successful attacks on others of his flying columns, Palombini once
more drew his men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>
together, and concentrated them in the upland plain of Hused near
Daroca. From thence he made another blow at Villacampa, who was at
the same time attacked in the rear by a column sent up by Suchet from
Valencia to Teruel. The Spaniard, however, easily avoided the attempt
to surround him, and retired without much loss or difficulty into the
wild Sierra de Albarracin (April 18th). Meanwhile, seeing Palombini
occupied in hunting Villacampa, the guerrillero Gayan made a dash at
the new garrison of Calatayud, and entering the city unexpectedly
captured the governor and sixty men, but failed to reduce the fortified
convent in which the rest of the Italians took refuge [April 29th].
He then sat down to besiege them, though he had no guns, and could
work by mines alone: but Palombini soon sent a strong column under the
brigadiers Saint Paul and Schiazzetti, who drove off Gayan and relieved
Calatayud [May 9th].</p>

<p>Nevertheless three months had now gone by since the attempt to
reduce southern Aragon began, and it was now obvious that it had been
wholly unsuccessful. The hills and great part of the upland plains were
still in the possession of the Spaniards, who had been often hunted
but never caught nor seriously mishandled. Palombini owned nothing
more than the towns which he had garrisoned, and the spot on which
his head-quarters chanced for the moment to be placed. His strength
was not sufficient to enable him to occupy every village, and without
such occupation no conquest could take place. Moreover the time was at
hand when Wellington’s operations in the West were to shake the fabric
of French power all over Spain—even in the remote recesses of the
Aragonese Sierras. Palombini was to be drawn off in July to join the
Army of the Centre and to oppose the English. And with his departure
such hold as the French possessed on the rugged region between
Calatayud, Saragossa, and Teruel was to disappear.</p>

<p>It will be noted that during these operations of the spring no
mention has been made of the Empecinado, who had been so prominent in
this quarter during the preceding autumn and winter. This chief was
now at the bottom of his fortunes: raiding in New Castile after his
accustomed fashion, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p.
102]</span> been completely defeated by General Guy and a column of
King Joseph’s army near Siguenza (February 7). He lost 1,000 men, only
saved his own person by throwing himself down an almost impracticable
cliff, and saw his whole force dispersed. This affair is said to have
been the result of treachery: one of the Empecinado’s lieutenants, a
certain guerrillero leader named Albuir (better known as El Manco from
having lost a hand) being taken prisoner a few days before, saved his
neck by betraying his chief’s position and plans: hence the surprise.
El Manco entered the King’s service and raised a ‘counter-guerrilla’
band, with which he did considerable harm for a space. The Empecinado
had only collected 600 men even by April, when he joined Villacampa
and aided him in a raid round Guadalajara<a id="FNanchor_96"
href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p>Mina, on the other hand, the greatest of all the partisans, was
doing some of his best service to the cause of liberty during the
early months of 1812. This was the period when he was conducting his
bloody campaign of reprisals against Abbé, the governor of Navarre, who
had published in December 1811 the celebrated proclamation which not
only prohibited any quarter for guerrilleros, but made their families
and villages responsible for them, and authorized the execution of
‘hostages’ levied on them, as well as the infliction of crushing fines.
Mina replied by the formal declaration of a ‘war of extermination
against all French without distinction of rank,’ and started the system
of shooting four prisoners for every Spaniard, soldier or civilian,
executed by the enemy. This he actually carried out for some months,
till the French proclamation was withdrawn. The most horrid incident
of this reign of terror was the shooting by the French, on March 21,
of the four members of the ‘insurrectional junta’ of the province
of Burgos, all magistrates and civilians, whom they had captured in
a raid, and the counter-execution of eighty French soldiers by the
Curate Merino, one of Mina’s colleagues, a few days later. This time of
atrocities ended shortly after, when Abbé withdrew his proclamation and
Mina followed his example.</p>

<p>On the departure of Reille’s troops from Valencia it will be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span> remembered that one of
his French brigades, that of Pannetier, had been sent as escort to the
captive Spaniards of Blake’s army. While the remainder of the new ‘Army
of the Ebro’ went off in the direction of Lerida, as has already been
seen, this brigade was turned aside against Mina. Dorsenne at the same
time directed the greater part of his available field-force to join in
the hunt, and all such of Caffarelli’s troops as were not shut up in
garrisons were told off for the same purpose. These detachments, when
added to the normal force of occupation in Navarre and Biscay, made
up in all some 30,000 men. Divided into many columns, each of which
was strong enough to face the 3,000 or 4,000 irregulars under Mina’s
command, they endeavoured to converge upon him, and to enclose him
within the net of their operations. The chase was very hot in March: on
the first of that month Caffarelli invaded the remote Pyrenean valley
of Roncal, where it had been discovered that Mina kept his dépôts, his
ammunition factory, and his hospitals. The valley was swept clean, but
no appreciable number of the guerrilleros were captured. On the 24th,
however, it looked as if disaster was impending, as three columns under
Abbé, Dumoustier (who had a brigade of the Young Guard), and Laferrière
had succeeded in disposing themselves around Mina’s main body, between
Sanguessa and Ochagavia. The guerrillero, however, saved himself by a
night march of incredible difficulty across impracticable hills, and
got away into Aragon. He was lost to sight, and was believed to have
been too harassed to be formidable for many a day.</p>

<p>Such was not the true state of affairs. Mina at once came back to
his old haunts, by a circuitous march through southern Navarre, and
on April 9th performed one of his most notable exploits. On that day
he surprised an immense convoy of convalescents, civilians, baggage,
and food-stuffs, which was marching from Vittoria to Mondragon, in
the Pass of Salinas (or Puerto de Arlaban). Though escorted by 2,000
men (including the whole of the 7th Polish regiment just drawn off
from Soult for the Russian war), it was completely destroyed. Five
hundred of the Poles were slain, 150 captured, and an enormous booty,
including (it is said) several hundred thousand francs in cash, fell
into Mina’s hands. He also delivered 450 Spanish<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> prisoners, who were being conducted to
captivity beyond the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Such an exploit naturally drew down once more upon Mina the
attention of all the neighbouring French commanders: Dorsenne and
Reille again sent columns to aid the governor of Navarre, and from
the 23rd to the 28th of April Mina was being hunted by powerful
detachments converging on him from all sides<a id="FNanchor_97"
href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. He himself was very
nearly captured at Robres by General Pannetier—who surprised him at
dawn, helped by treachery on the part of a subordinate guerrillero
chief, and dispersed his followers for the moment<a id="FNanchor_98"
href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. But all who were not
slain or captured rallied around their indomitable leader, and followed
him in a hazardous retreat, in which he threaded his way between the
converging columns of the French and ultimately escaped to the Rioja.
He asserts in his Memoirs, and with truth, that he was at this time of
the highest service to Wellington’s main operations, since he attracted
and detained beyond the Ebro such a large proportion of Dorsenne’s Army
of the North, that in April and May it had not a man to spare to help
Marmont. Even Dumoustier’s Guard division, under orders to return to
France for the Russian war, was put into the pack of pursuers who tried
in vain to hunt him down.</p>

<p>To sum up the results of all the operations in Catalonia, Aragon,
and Navarre, which followed on the release of Reille’s troops from
the Valencian expedition, it may be said that Napoleon’s scheme for
the complete reduction of north-eastern Spain had completely failed
by April. Large forces had been put in motion; toilsome marches had
been executed over many mountain roads in the worst season of the
year; all the bands of the insurgents had been more than once defeated
and dispersed. But the country-side was not conquered: the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span> isolated garrisons were
still cut off from each other by the enemy, wherever the heavy marching
columns had passed on. The communications were no more safe and free
than they had been in December. The loss of men by sickness and in
the innumerable petty combats and disasters had been immense. The
game had yet to be finished, and the spare time in which it could be
conducted was drawing to an end. For Wellington was on the march, and
ere long not a man from the Armies of the North or the Centre was to
be available to aid Reille, Suchet, and Decaen in their unending and
ungrateful task. Gone, too, were the days in which reserves without end
could be poured in from France: the Russian war was about to open, and
when once it began reinforcements were to be drawn from Spain rather
than sent into it. The invasion had reached its high-water mark in
January 1812 before the walls of Valencia and Alicante.</p>

  <p class="subh3">OPERATIONS OF SOULT IN ANDALUSIA: THE SIEGE
    OF&nbsp;TARIFA, DEC. 1811-JAN. 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In the</span> south-west no less than in the
south-east of Spain the month of January 1812 was to witness the last
offensive movement of the French armies of invasion. But while Suchet’s
advance ended, as we have seen, in a splendid success, that of Soult
was to meet with a disastrous check. Neither marshal was to have
another chance of taking the initiative—thanks, directly or indirectly,
to the working out of Wellington’s great plan of campaign for the New
Year.</p>

<p>In the previous volume the fortunes of Soult and the Army of
Andalusia were narrated down to the first days of November 1811,
when Hill’s raid into Estremadura, after the surprise of Arroyo dos
Molinos, ended with his retreat within the borders of Portugal. That
raid had inflicted a severe blow on Drouet’s corps of observation,
which formed Soult’s right wing, and covered his communications with
Badajoz. But its net result was only to restrict the activities of
the French on this side to that part of Estremadura which lies south
of the Guadiana. Hill had made no attempt to drive away Drouet’s
main body, or to blockade Badajoz, and had betaken himself to winter
quarters about Elvas, Portalegre, and Estremos. Consequently Drouet
was able to settle down opposite him once more, in equally widespread
cantonments, with his right wing at Merida, and his left at Zafra,
and to devote his attention to sending successive convoys forward to
Badajoz, whenever the stores in that fortress showed signs of running
low. Drouet’s force no longer bore the name of the ‘5th Corps’—all the
old corps distinctions were abolished in the Southern Army this autumn,
and no organization larger than that of the divisions was permitted to
remain. The troops in Estremadura were simply<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span> for the future Drouet’s and Daricau’s
divisions of the ‘Armée du Midi.’ The composition of this ‘containing
force,’ whose whole purpose was now to observe Hill, was somewhat
changed after midwinter: for the Emperor sent orders that the 34th
and 40th regiments, the victims of Girard’s carelessness at Arroyo
dos Molinos, were to be sent home to France to recruit their much
depleted ranks. They duly left Drouet, and marched off northward<a
id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, but
they never got further than Burgos, where Dorsenne detained them
at a moment of need, so that they became attached to the ‘Army of
the North,’ and (after receiving some drafts) were involved in the
operations against Wellington in the valley of the Douro. Two regiments
from Andalusia (the 12th Léger and 45th Line) came up to replace them
in Drouet’s division, but even then the French troops in Estremadura
did not exceed 13,500 men, if the garrison of Badajoz (about 5,000
strong) be deducted. This constituted a field-force insufficient to
hold back Hill when next he should take the offensive; but all through
November and far into December Hill remained quiescent, by Wellington’s
orders, and his adversary clung to his advanced positions as long as
he could, though much disturbed as to what the future might bring
forth.</p>

<p>Of the remainder of Soult’s army, the troops in front of Cadiz,
originally the 1st Corps, had been cut down to an irreducible
minimum, by the necessity for keeping flank-guards to either side,
to watch the Spanish forces in the Condado de Niebla on the west and
the mountains of Ronda on the south. Even including the marines and
sailors of the flotilla, there were seldom 20,000 men in the Lines,
and the Spanish force in Cadiz and the Isle of Leon, stiffened by the
Anglo-Portuguese detachment which Wellington always retained there, was
often not inferior in numbers to the besiegers. The bombardment from
the heavy Villoutreys mortars, placed in the works of the Matagorda
peninsula, continued intermittently: but, though a shell occasionally
fell in the city, no appreciable harm was done.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span> The inhabitants killed or injured by many
months of shelling could be counted on the fingers of two hands. The
citizens had come to take the occasional descent of a missile in their
streets with philosophic calm, and sang a derisive street ditty which
told how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">‘De las bombas que tiran los Gavachos</p>
<p class="i0">Se hacen las Gaditanas tirabuzones.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">‘The splinters of the bombs that the French threw served
the ladies of Cadiz as weights to curl their hair<a id="FNanchor_100"
href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Fort of Puntales, on the easternmost point of the isthmus that
links Cadiz to the Isle of Leon, felt the bombardment more severely,
but was never seriously injured, and always succeeded in keeping up
an effective return fire. With the artillery of those days—even when
mortars of the largest calibre, specially cast in the arsenal of
Seville, were used—Cadiz was safe from any real molestation.</p>

<p>Marshal Victor was still in command of the troops in the Lines at
the end of 1811, but the Emperor gave orders for his return to France,
when he ordered the Army of Andalusia to drop its organization into
army-corps, and replaced them by divisions. He directed that the
Marshal should set out at once, unless he was engaged in some serious
enterprise at the moment that the summons arrived. This—as we shall
see—chanced to be the case, and Victor was still hard at work in
January, and did not leave Spain till early in April.</p>

<p>The third main section of Soult’s troops consisted of the two
infantry and one cavalry divisions which had lately formed the 4th
Corps, and had, since their first arrival in the South, been told off
for the occupation of the kingdom of Granada. The whole of the coast
and the inland from Malaga as far as Baza fell to their charge. The
corps had been a strong one—16,000 foot and 4,000 horse—but was shortly
to be reduced; the order of December 30, recalling troops for the
expected Russian war, took off the whole Polish infantry division of
Dembouski, 5,000 bayonets: the regiment of Lancers of the Vistula, who
had won such fame by their charge at Albuera,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span> was also requisitioned, but did not get
off till the autumn. But in the last month of the old year the Poles
were still present and available, and Soult was far from expecting
their departure. Yet even before they were withdrawn the garrison of
the kingdom of Granada was by no means too strong for the work allotted
to it. The greater part of its available field-force had been drawn
to the south-west, to curb the insurrection of the <i>Serranos</i> of the
Ronda mountains, and the inroads of Ballasteros. The forces left in
Granada itself and the other eastern towns were so modest that Soult
protested, and apparently with truth, that he could not spare from
them even a small flying column of all arms, to make the demonstration
against Murcia in assistance of Suchet’s operations which the Emperor
ordered him to execute. Nothing, as it will be remembered, was done
in this direction during December and January, save the sending out
of Pierre Soult’s raid<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, a mere affair of a single cavalry
brigade.</p>

<p>The total force of the Andalusian army was still in December as high
as 80,000 men on paper. But after deducting the sick, the garrison
of Badajoz—5,000 men,—the troops of Drouet, entirely taken up with
observing and containing Hill, the divisions in the Lines before Cadiz,
and the obligatory garrisons of Granada, Malaga, Cordova, and other
large towns, the surplus left over for active operations was very
small. At the most ten or twelve thousand men, obtained by borrowing
from all sides, could be formed to act as a central reserve, prepared
to assist Drouet in Estremadura, Victor in the Cadiz region, or Leval
in the East, as occasion might demand. During the two crises when Soult
brought up his reserves to join Drouet, in the winter of 1811-12 and
the spring of 1812, their joint force did not exceed 25,000 men. The
Marshal was resolved to hold the complete circuit of Andalusia, the
viceroyalty which brought him so much pride and profit; and so long as
he persisted in this resolve he could make no offensive move, for want
of a field army of competent strength.</p>

<p>Soult made some effort to supplement the strength of his garrisons
by raising Spanish levies—both battalions and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span> squadrons of regulars, and units for
local service in the style of urban guards. The former ‘Juramentados’
never reached any great strength: they were composed of deserters,
or prisoners who volunteered service in order to avoid being sent to
France. Occasionally there were as many as 5,000 under arms—usually
less. The men for the most part disappeared at the first opportunity,
and rejoined the national army or the guerrilleros: the officers were
less prone to abscond, because they were liable to be shot as traitors
on returning to their countrymen. Two or three cases are recorded
of such renegades who committed suicide, when they saw themselves
about to fall into the hands of Spanish troops<a id="FNanchor_102"
href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. The urban guards or
‘escopeteros’ were of a little more service, for the reason that,
being interested in the preservation of their own families, goods, and
houses, they would often prevent the entry into their towns of any
roving Spanish force which showed itself for a moment. For if they
admitted any small band, which went on its way immediately, and could
make no attempt to defend them on the reappearance of the enemy, they
were liable to be executed as traitors by the French, and their town
would be fined or perhaps sacked. Hence it was to their interest,
so long as Soult continued to dominate all Andalusia, to keep the
guerrilleros outside their walls. But their service was, of course,
unwilling; and they were usually ready to yield on the appearance of
any serious Spanish force, whose size was sufficient to excuse their
submission in the eyes of Soult. Often a town was ostensibly held for
King Joseph, but was privately supplying recruits, provisions, and
money contributions to the national cause. Nevertheless there were real
‘Afrancesados’ in Andalusia, people who had so far committed themselves
to the cause of King Joseph that they could not contemplate the triumph
of the Patriots without terror. When Soult evacuated Andalusia in
September 1812 several thousand refugees followed him, rather than
face the vengeance of their countrymen.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span></p> <p>During the midwinter of 1811-12
Soult’s main attention was taken up by a serious enterprise in the
extreme south of his viceroyalty, which absorbed all the spare
battalions of his small central reserve, and rendered it impossible
for him to take the offensive in any other direction. This was the
attempt to crush Ballasteros, and to capture Tarifa, which rendered his
co-operation in Suchet’s Valencian campaign impossible.</p>

<p>General Ballasteros, as it will be remembered, had landed from Cadiz
at Algeciras on September 4th, 1811, and had been much hunted during
the autumn by detachments drawn both from the troops in the kingdom of
Granada and those of Victor<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. As many as 10,000 men were pressing him
in October, when he had been forced to take refuge under the cannon
of Gibraltar. But when want of food compelled the columns of Barrois,
Sémélé, and Godinot to withdraw and to disperse, he had emerged
from his refuge, had followed the retiring enemy, and had inflicted
some damage on their rearguards [November 5, 1811]. His triumphant
survival, after the first concentrated movement made against him, had
much provoked Soult, who saw the insurrectionary movement in southern
Andalusia spreading all along the mountains, and extending itself
towards Malaga on the one side and Arcos on the other. The Marshal,
therefore, determined to make a serious effort to crush Ballasteros,
and at the same time to destroy one of the two bases from which he was
wont to operate. Gibraltar was, of course, impregnable: but Tarifa, the
other fortress at the southern end of the Peninsula, was not, and had
proved from time to time very useful to the Spaniards. It was now their
only secure foothold in southern Andalusia, and was most useful as a
port of call for vessels going round from Cadiz to the Mediterranean,
especially for the large flotilla of British and Spanish sloops, brigs,
and gunboats, which obsessed the coast of Andalusia, and made the use
of routes by the seaside almost impracticable for the enemy. Soult
was at this time trying to open up communications with the Moors of
Tangier, from whom he hoped to get horses for his cavalry, and oxen for
the army before Cadiz. But he could not hope to accomplish anything in
this way so long as Tarifa was the nest and victualling-place of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> privateers, who lay thick
in the straits only a few miles from the coast of Morocco.</p>

<p>The main reason for attacking Tarifa, however, was that it had
recently become the head-quarters of a small Anglo-Spanish field-force,
which had been molesting the rear of the lines before Cadiz. The place
had not been garrisoned in 1810, when Soult first broke into Andalusia:
but a few months after General Colin Campbell, governor of Gibraltar,
threw into it a small force, that same battalion of flank-companies
of the 9th, 28th, 30th, and 47th Foot, which distinguished itself
so much at Barrosa in the following year, when led by Colonel Brown
of the 28th. This hard fighter had moved on with his regiment later
in 1811, but his place had been taken by Major King of the 82nd—a
one-legged officer of great energy and resolution<a id="FNanchor_104"
href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. The garrison was
trifling down to October 1811, when General Campbell threw into
Tarifa a brigade under Colonel Skerrett, consisting of the 2/47th and
2/87th, and some details<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, making (with the original garrison)
1,750 British troops. Three days later the Spaniards sent in from
Cadiz another brigade<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106"
class="fnanchor">[106]</a> of about the same strength, under General
Copons. After the French expedition against Ballasteros had failed,
Copons and Skerrett went out and drove from Vejer the southernmost
outposts of Victor’s corps in the Lines (November 6th). A fortnight
later they marched across the hills to Algeciras, and prepared
to join Ballasteros in an attack on the French troops in the
direction of Ronda, but returned to Tarifa on the news that Victor
was showing a considerable force at Vejer, and threatening to cut
them off from their base<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. Ballasteros by himself was a sufficient
nuisance to Soult, but when his operations began to be aided by another
separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> force,
partly composed of British troops, the Duke of Dalmatia determined that
a clean sweep must be made in southern Andalusia.</p>

<p>The idea of capturing Tarifa did not appear by any means
impracticable. This little decayed place of 6,000 souls had never been
fortified in the modern style, and was surrounded by nothing more
than a mediaeval wall eight feet thick, with square towers set in it
at intervals. There was a citadel, the castle of Guzman El Bueno<a
id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>,
but this, too, was a thirteenth-century building, and the whole
place, though tenable against an enemy unprovided with artillery, was
reckoned helpless against siege-guns. It is described by one of its
defenders as ‘lying in a hole,’ for it was completely commanded by a
range of low heights, at no greater distance than 300 yards from its
northern front. In the sea, half a mile beyond it, was a rocky island,
connected with the mainland by a very narrow strip of sand, which was
well suited to serve as a final place of refuge for the garrison, and
which had been carefully fortified. It was furnished with batteries,
of which one bore on the sand-spit and the town: a redoubt (Santa
Catalina) had been erected at the point where the isthmus joined the
mainland: several buildings had been erected to serve as a shelter
for troops, and a great series of caves (Cueva de los Moros) had been
converted into casemates and store-rooms: they were perfectly safe
against bombardment. In the eyes of many officers the island was
the real stronghold, and the city was but an outwork to it, which
might be evacuated without any serious damage to the strength of the
defence. Nevertheless something had been done to improve the weak
fortifications of the place: the convent of San Francisco, seventy
yards from its northern point, had been entrenched and loopholed, to
serve as a redoubt, and some of the square towers in the <i>enceinte</i> had
been strengthened and built up so as to bear artillery. The curtain,
however, was in all parts far too narrow and weak to allow of guns
being placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> upon
it, and there was no glacis and practically no ditch, the whole wall to
its foot being visible from the heights which overlook the city on its
eastern side. There were only twenty-six guns available, and of these
part belonged to the defences of the island. In the town itself there
were only two heavy guns mounted on commanding towers, six field-pieces
(9-pounders) distributed along the various fronts, and four mortars.
When the siege actually began, the main defence was by musketry fire.
It was clear from the topography of Tarifa that its northern front,
that nearest to and most completely commanded by the hills outside,
would be the probable point of attack by the enemy; and long before
the siege began preparations were made for an interior defence. The
buildings looking on the back of the ramparts were barricaded and
loopholed, the narrow streets were blocked with traverses, and some
‘entanglements’ were contrived with the iron window-bars requisitioned
from all the houses of the town, which served as a sort of <i>chevaux de
frise</i>. The outer <i>enceinte</i> was so weak that it was intended that the
main defence should be in the network of streets. Special preparations
were thought out for the right-centre of the north front, where the
walls are pierced by the ravine of a winter torrent of intermittent
flow, called the Retiro. The point where it made its passage under the
<i>enceinte</i> through a portcullis was the lowest place in the front,
the walls sinking down as they followed the outline of the ravine.
Wherefore palisades were planted outside the portcullis, entanglements
behind it, and all the houses looking down on the torrent bed within
the walls were prepared with loopholes commanding its course<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.
There was ample time for work, for while the first certain news that
the French were coming arrived in November, the enemy did not actually
appear before the walls till December 20. By that time much had been
done, though the balance was only completed in haste after the siege
had begun.</p>

<p>The long delay of the enemy was caused by the abominable condition
of the roads of the district—the same that had given Graham and
La Peña so much trouble in February 1811<a id="FNanchor_110"
href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>:<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> moreover, any considerable concentration
of troops in southern Andalusia raised a food problem for Soult. The
region round Tarifa is very thinly inhabited, and it was clear that, if
a large army were collected, it would have to carry its provisions with
it, and secure its communication with its base, under pain of falling
into starvation within a few days. Heavy guns abounded in the Cadiz
lines, and Soult had no trouble in selecting a siege-train of sixteen
pieces from them: but their transport and that of their ammunition
was a serious problem. To complete the train no less than 500 horses
had to be requisitioned from the field artillery and military wagons
of the 1st Corps. While it was being collected, Victor moved forward
to Vejer, near the coast, half-way between Cadiz and Tarifa, with
2,000 men, in order to clear the country-side from the guerrillero
bands, who made survey of the roads difficult and dangerous. Under
cover of escorts furnished by him, several intelligence officers
inspected the possible routes: there were two, both passing through the
mountainous tract between the sea and the lagoon of La Janda (which
had given Graham so much trouble in the last spring). One came down
to the waterside at the chapel of Virgen de la Luz, only three miles
from Tarifa, but was reported to be a mere mule-track. The other,
somewhat more resembling a road, descended to the shore several miles
farther to the north, and ran parallel with it for some distance. But
in expectation of the siege, the Spaniards, with help from English
ships, had blown up many yards of this road, where it was narrowest
between the water and the mountain. Moreover, ships of war were
always stationed off Tarifa, and their guns would make passage along
this defile dangerous. Nevertheless General Garbé, the chief French
engineer, held that this was the only route practicable for artillery,
and reported that the road could be remade, and that the flotilla might
be kept at a distance by building batteries on the shore, which would
prevent any vessel from coming close enough to deliver an effective
fire. It was determined, therefore, that the siege-train should take
this path, which for the first half of its way passes close along
the marshy borders of the lagoon of La Janda, and then enters the
hills in order to descend to the sea at Torre Peña.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span></p> <p>On December 8th
the siege-train was concentrated at Vejer, and in the hope that it
would in four days (or not much more) reach its destination before
Tarifa, Victor gave orders for the movement of the troops which were
to conduct the siege. Of this force the smaller part, six battalions<a
id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and
two cavalry regiments, was drawn from Leval’s command, formerly the
4th Corps. These two divisions had also to provide other detachments
to hold Malaga in strength, and watch Ballasteros. The troops from
the blockade of Cadiz supplied eight battalions<a id="FNanchor_112"
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>, and three more to
keep up communications<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a>; one additional regiment was borrowed from
the brigade in the kingdom of Cordova, which was always drawn upon
in times of special need<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114"
class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. The whole force put in motion was some
15,000 men, but only 10,000 actually came before Tarifa and took part
in the siege.</p>

<p>The various columns, which were under orders to march, came from
distant points, and had to concentrate. Barrois lay at Los Barrios,
inland from Algeciras, with six battalions from the Cadiz lines,
watching Ballasteros, who had once more fallen back under shelter of
the guns of Gibraltar. To this point Leval came to join him, with the
3,000 men drawn from Malaga and Granada. The third column, under Victor
himself, consisting of the siege-train and the battalions told off for
its escort, came from the side of Vejer. All three were to meet before
Tarifa: but from the first start difficulties began to arise owing to
the bad weather.</p>

<p>The winter, which had hitherto been mild and equable, broke up
into unending rain-storms on the day appointed for the start, and the
sudden filling of the torrents in the mountains cut the communications
between the columns. Leval, who had got as far as the pass of Ojen, in
the range which separates the district about Algeciras and Los Barrios
from the Tarifa region, was forced to halt there for some days: but
his rear, a brigade under Cassagne, could not come forward to join
him, nor did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
the convoy-column succeed in advancing far from Vejer. Victor sent
three successive officers with escorts to try to get into touch with
Cassagne, but each returned without having been able to push through.
It was not till the 12th that a fourth succeeded in reaching the
belated column, which only got under way that day and joined on the
following afternoon. The siege-train was not less delayed, and was
blocked for several days by the overflowing of the lagoon of La Janda,
along whose shore its first stages lay. It only struggled through to
the south end of the lagoon on the 14th, and took no less than four
days more to cover the distance of sixteen miles across the hills to
Torre Peña, where the road comes down to the sea. Forty horses, it
is said, had to be harnessed to each heavy gun to pull it through<a
id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.
Much of the ammunition was spoilt by the rain, which continued to fall
intermittently, and more had to be requisitioned from the Cadiz lines,
and to be brought forward by supplementary convoys.</p>

<p>These initial delays went far to wreck the whole scheme, because of
the food problem. Each of the columns had to bring its own provisions
with it, and, when stopped on the road, consumed stores that had been
intended to serve it during the siege. The distance from Vejer to
Tarifa is only thirty miles, and from Los Barrios to Tarifa even less:
but the columns, which had been ordered to march on December 8th, did
not reach their destination till December 20th, and the communications
behind them were cut already, not by the enemy but by the vile weather,
which had turned every mountain stream into a torrent, and every
low-lying bottom into a marsh. The column with the siege artillery
arrived two days later: it had got safely through the defile of Torre
Peña: the sappers had repaired the road by the water, and had built a
masked battery for four 12-pounders and two howitzers, whose fire kept
off from the dangerous point several Spanish and English gunboats which
came up to dispute the passage. The column from the pass of Ojen had
been somewhat delayed in its march by a sally of Ballasteros, who came
out from the Gibraltar lines on the 17th-18th and fell upon its rear
with 2,000 men. He drove in the last battalion, but when Barrois turned
back and attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span>
him with a whole brigade, the Spaniard gave way and retreated in haste
to San Roque. Nevertheless, by issuing from his refuge and appearing in
the open, he had cut the communications between the army destined for
the siege and the troops at Malaga. At the same time that Ballasteros
made this diversion, Skerrett, with his whole brigade and a few of
Copons’s Spaniards, had issued from Tarifa to demonstrate against the
head of the approaching French column, and advanced some distance on
the road to Fascinas, where his handful of hussars bickered with the
leading cavalry in the enemy’s front. Seeing infantry behind, he took
his main body no farther forward than the convent of Nuestra Señora de
la Luz, three miles from the fortress. On the 19th the French showed
4,000 men on the surrounding hills, and on the 20th advanced in force
in two columns, and pushed the English and Spanish pickets into Tarifa,
after a long skirmish in which the British had 31, the Spaniards about
40 casualties, while the French, according to Leval’s report, lost only
1 officer and 3 men killed and 27 wounded. By four in the afternoon
the place was invested—the French pickets reaching from sea to sea,
and their main body being encamped behind the hills which command
the northern side of Tarifa. They could not place themselves near
the water, owing to the fire of two British frigates and a swarm of
gunboats, which lay in-shore, and shelled their flanks all day, though
without great effect.</p>

<p>Copons and Skerrett had divided the manning of the town and island
between their brigades on equal terms, each keeping two battalions in
the town and a third in the island and the minor posts. Of the British
the 47th and 87th had the former, King’s battalion of flank-companies
(reinforced by 70 marines landed from the ships) the latter charge. The
convent of San Francisco was held by a company of the 82nd, the redoubt
of Santa Catalina on the isthmus by one of the 11th. Seeing the French
inactive on the 21st—they were waiting for the siege-train which was
not yet arrived—Skerrett sent out three companies to drive in their
pickets, and shelled the heights behind which they were encamped. On
the following day the sortie was repeated, by a somewhat larger force
under Colonel Gough of the 87th, covered by a flanking fire from the
gunboats. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span> right
wing of the French pickets was driven in with some loss, and a house
too near the Santa Catalina redoubt demolished. The besiegers lost 3
men killed and 4 officers and 19 men wounded, mainly from the 16th
Léger. The sallying troops had only 1 man killed and 5 wounded (2 from
the 11th, 4 from the 87th). That night the siege-train arrived, and was
parked behind the right-hand hill of the three which face the northern
side of Tarifa.</p>

<p>The engineer officers who had come up with the siege-train executed
their survey of the fortress next morning, and reported (as might have
been expected) that it would be best to attack the central portion of
the north front, because the ground facing it was not exposed to any
fire from the vessels in-shore, as was the west front, and could only
be searched by the two or three guns which the besieged had mounted on
the towers of Jesus and of Guzman, the one in the midst of the northern
front, the other in a dominating position by the castle, at the
southern corner. However, the 24-pounders on the island, shooting over
the town, could throw shells on to the hillside where the French were
about to work, though without being able to judge of their effect.</p>

<p>On the night of the 23rd the French began their first parallel, on
their right flank of the central hill, at a distance of 300 yards from
the walls: the approaches to it needed no spadework, being completely
screened by a ravine and a thick aloe hedge. The besieged shelled it on
the succeeding day, but with small effect—only 3 workers were killed
and 4 wounded. On the 24th a minor front of attack was developed on
the left-hand hill, where a first parallel was thrown up about 250
yards from the walls. The gunboats on the southern shore fired on this
work when it was discovered, but as it was invisible to them, and as
they could only shoot at haphazard, by directions signalled from the
town, they generally failed to hit the mark, and did little to prevent
the progress of the digging. The besiegers only lost 4 killed and 25
wounded this day, and on the original point of attack were able to
commence a second parallel, in which there was marked out the place for
the battery which was destined to breach the town wall at the lowest
point of its circuit, just south of the bed of the Retiro torrent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>On the two
following days the French continued to push forward with no great
difficulty; they completed the second parallel on the centre hill,
parts of which were only 180 yards from the town. On the left or
eastern hill the trenches were continued down the inner slope, as far
as the bottom of the ravine, so as almost to join those of the right
attack. On the 26th a violent south-east gale began to blow, which
compelled the British and Spanish gunboats to quit their station to
the right of Tarifa, lest they should be driven ashore, and to run
round to the west side of the island which gave them shelter from wind
coming from such a quarter. The French works were, therefore, only
molested for the future by the little 6-pounders on the north-east (or
Corchuela) tower, and the heavy guns firing at a high trajectory from
the island and the tower of Guzman.</p>

<p>But the gale was accompanied by rain, and this, beginning with
moderate showers on the 26th, developed into a steady downpour on the
27th and 28th, and commenced to make the spadework in the trenches
more laborious, as the sappers were up to their ankles in mud, and
the excavated earth did not bind easily into parapets owing to its
semi-liquid condition. Nevertheless the plans of the engineers were
carried out, and two batteries were finished and armed on the central
hill, one lower down to batter the walls, the other higher up, to deal
with the guns of the besieged and silence them if possible. The French
lined all the advanced parallel with sharpshooters, who kept up a heavy
fire on the ramparts, and would have made it difficult for the garrison
to maintain a reply, if a large consignment of sandbags had not been
received from Gibraltar, with which cover was contrived for the men on
the curtain, and the artillery in the towers.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock on the morning of the 29th the two French
batteries opened<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, with twelve heavy guns. The weakness of
the old town wall at once became evident: the first shot fired went
completely through it, and lodged in a house to its rear. Before
evening there was a definite breach produced, just south<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span> of the Retiro ravine, and
it was clear that the enemy would be able to increase it to any extent
that he pleased—the masonry fell to pieces the moment that it was well
pounded. The two small field-guns on the tower of Jesus were silenced
by 3 o’clock, and the heavy gun on Guzman’s tower also ceased firing—of
which more anon. By night only the distant guns on the island, and the
ships in the south-western bay, were making an effective reply to the
French.</p>

<p>This, from the psychological point of view, was the critical day
of the siege, for on the clear demonstration of the weakness of the
walls, Colonel Skerrett, who had never much confidence in his defences,
proposed to evacuate the city of Tarifa. At a council of officers he
argued in favour of withdrawing the garrison into the island, and
making no attempt to hold the weak mediaeval walls which the French
were so effectively battering. This would have been equivalent, in
the end, to abandoning the entire foothold of the British on this
point of the coast. For there was on the island no cover for troops,
save two or three recently erected buildings, and the recesses of
the ‘Cueva de los Moros.’ Some of the inhabitants had already taken
refuge there, and were suffering great privations, from being exposed
to the weather in tents and hastily contrived huts. It is clear that
if 3,000 men, British and Spanish, had been lodged on the wind-swept
rocks of the island, it would soon have been necessary to withdraw
them; however inaccessible the water-girt rock, with its low cliffs,
might be, no large body of troops could have lived long upon it,
exposed as they would have been not only to wind and wet, but to
constant molestation by heavy guns placed in and about the city and the
hills that dominate it. Meanwhile the French would have possessed the
excellent cover of the houses of Tarifa, and would have effectively
blocked the island by leaving a garrison to watch the causeway, the
only possible exit from it. It is certain that the abandonment of
the island would have followed that of the town within a few days:
indeed Skerrett had already obtained leave from General Cooke, then
commanding at Cadiz, to bring his brigade round to that port as soon
as he should feel it necessary. He regarded the evacuation of the
place as so certain, that he ordered the 18-pounder gun on Guzman’s
tower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> to be spiked
this day, though it was the only piece of heavy calibre in the city<a
id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>—the
reason given was that one of its missiles (spherical case-shot) had
fallen short within the streets, and killed or wounded an inhabitant.
But the real cause was that he had fully decided on abandoning Tarifa
that night or the following day, and thought the moving of such a big
gun in a hurry impossible—it had been hoisted with great difficulty to
its place by the sailors, with cranes and tackle<a id="FNanchor_118"
href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p>Skerrett stated his decision in favour of the evacuation at the
council of war, produced General Cooke’s letter supporting his plan,
and stated that Lord Proby, his second in command, concurred in the
view of its necessity. Fortunately for the credit of the British arms,
his opinion was boldly traversed by Captain C. F. Smith, the senior
engineer officer, Major King commanding the Gibraltar battalion of
flank-companies, and Colonel Gough of the 87th. The former urged that
the town should be defended, as an outwork of the island, to the last
possible moment: though the breach was practicable, he had already made
arrangements for cutting it off by retrenchments from the body of the
town. The streets had been blocked and barricaded, and all the houses
looking upon the back of the walls loopholed. Tarifa could be defended
for some time in the style of Saragossa, lane by lane. He pointed out
that such was the configuration of the ground that if the enemy entered
the breach, he would find a fourteen-foot drop between its rear and the
ground below, on to which he would have to descend under a concentric
fire of musketry from all the neighbouring buildings. Even supposing
that the worst came, the garrison had the castle to retire into, and
this was tenable until breached by artillery, while a retreat from it
to the island would always be possible, under cover of the guns of the
flotilla. There was no profit or credit in giving up outworks before
they were forced. Major King concurred, and said that his battalion,
being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span> Gibraltar
troops, was under the direct orders of General Campbell, from whom he
had received directions to hold Tarifa till the last extremity. If
Skerrett’s brigade should embark, he and the flank-companies would
remain behind, to defend it, along with Copons’s Spaniards. Gough
concurred in the decision, and urged that the evacuation would be
wholly premature and ‘contrary to the spirit of General Campbell’s
instructions’ until it was seen whether the French were able to effect
a lodgement inside the walls<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<p>Skerrett’s resolve was shaken—he still held to his opinion, but
dismissed the council of war without coming to a decision: he tried
to avoid responsibility by requesting the officers who voted for
further resistance to deliver him their opinions in writing. This
King, Smith, and Gough did, in the strongest wording. The first named
of these three resolute men sent that same night a messenger by boat
to Gibraltar, to inform General Campbell of Skerrett’s faint-hearted
decision, and to observe that, with a few companies more to aid his own
flank-battalion and the Spaniards, he would try to hold first Tarifa
and then the island, even if Skerrett withdrew his brigade. Campbell,
angry in no small degree, sent a very prompt answer to the effect
that the town should not be abandoned without the concurrence of the
commanding officers of artillery and engineers, while the Gibraltar
battalion should be concentrated in the island, in order to ensure
its defence even if Tarifa itself fell. Still more drastic was an
order to the officers commanding the transports to bring their ships
back at once to Gibraltar: this decisive move made it impossible for
Skerrett to carry out his plan<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. A few days later Campbell sent two more
flank-companies to join the garrison—but they only arrived after the
assault.</p>

<p>The idea of evacuating the town without attempting any defence was
all the more ignominious because Copons had declared his intention of
holding it to the last, had protested against the spiking of the heavy
gun in Guzman’s tower, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p.
124]</span> next morning, when Leval summoned the place to surrender,
sent in a most unhesitating, if somewhat bombastic<a id="FNanchor_121"
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, note of refusal. If
Skerrett had withdrawn into the island, or taken to his ships, and
Copons had been overwhelmed, fighting in the streets, the disgrace to
the British flag would have been very great. As a sidelight on the
whole matter, we may remember that this was the same officer who had
refused to land his troops to defend the breach of Tarragona six months
before. He was no coward, as he showed in many fights, and he died
gallantly at Bergen-op-Zoom in 1814, but he was undoubtedly a shirker
of responsibilities.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th the besiegers’ batteries opened again,
and enlarged the breach to a broad gap of thirty feet or more; they
also dismounted a field-piece which the besieged had hoisted on the
Jesus tower, to replace those injured on the previous day. At midday
Leval sent in the summons already recorded, and receiving Copons’s
uncompromising reply, directed the fire to continue. It was very
effective, and by evening the breach was nearly sixty feet long,
occupying almost the whole space between the tower at the portcullis
over the ravine, and that next south of it. At dusk the garrison
crept out to clear the foot of the breach, and began also to redouble
the inner defences in the lanes and houses behind it. All work on
both sides, however, was stopped, shortly after nightfall, by a
most torrential downpour of rain, which drove the French from their
batteries and the English and Spaniards from their repairing. The sky
seemed to be falling—the hillsides became cataracts, and the Retiro
ravine was soon filled with a broad river which came swirling against
the walls, bearing with it fascines, planks, gabions, and even dead
bodies washed out of the French lines. Presently the mass of débris,
accumulating against the palisades erected in front of the portcullis,
and urged on by the water, swept away these outer defences, and then,
pressing against the portcullis itself, bent it inwards and twisted
it, despite of its massive iron clamps, so as to make an opening<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> into the town, down which
everything went swimming through the ravine. The flood also swept
away some of the defensive works on each side of the depression. When
the hurricane was over, the rain still continued to fall heavily, but
the garrison, emerging from shelter, commenced to repair their works,
and had undone much of the damage by daylight<a id="FNanchor_122"
href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>If the besieged had been sorely incommoded by the tempest, the
besiegers on the bare hillsides had been still worse tried. They had
been forced to abandon their trenches and batteries, of which those
high up the slope were water-logged, while those below had been largely
swept away by the flood. The breach had been pronounced practicable
by the engineers, and an assault had been fixed for dawn. But it
was necessary to put it off for some hours, in order to allow the
artillery to reoccupy their batteries, and recommence their fire, and
the infantry to come up from the camps where they had vainly tried
to shelter themselves during the downpour. Nevertheless the French
commanders resolved to storm as soon as the men could be assembled,
without waiting for further preparations. ‘The troops,’ says the French
historian of the siege, ‘unable to dry themselves, or to light fires
to cook their rations, loudly cried out for an assault, as the only
thing that could put an end to their misery.’ A large force had been
set apart for the storm, the grenadier and voltigeur companies of each
of the battalions engaged in the sieges, making a total of over 2,200
men. They were divided into two columns—the grenadiers were to storm
the breach; the voltigeurs to try whether the gap at the Portcullis
tower was practicable or not: they were to break in if possible, if
not, to engage the defenders in a fusilade which should distract their
attention from the main attack.</p>

<p>As soon as day dawned, the besieged could detect that the trenches
were filling, and that the storm was about to break. They had time
to complete their dispositions before the French moved: the actual
breach was held by Copons with a battalion of his own troops<a
id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>:
the 87th, under Gough, occupied the walls<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span> both to right and left of the breach,
including the Portcullis tower, with two companies in reserve. Captain
Levesey with 100 of the 47th was posted in the south-eastern (Jesus)
tower, which completely enfiladed the route which the enemy would have
to take to the foot of the breach. The rest of the 47th was in charge
of the south front of the town.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the column of French grenadiers issued from the
trenches near the advanced breaching battery, and dashed down the side
of the Retiro ravine towards the breach, while the voltigeur companies,
at the same time, running out from the approaches on the eastern hill,
advanced by the opposite side of the ravine towards the Portcullis
tower. Demonstrations to right and left were made by Cassagne’s brigade
on one flank and Pécheux’s on the other. The progress of the storming
column was not rapid—the slopes of the ravine were rain-sodden and
slippery; its bottom (where the flood had passed) was two feet deep in
mud. The troops were forced to move slowly, and the moment that they
were visible from the walls they became exposed to a very heavy fire of
musketry, both from the curtain and the enfilading towers on each of
their flanks. Of guns the besieged had only one available—a field-piece
in the northernmost (or Corchuela) tower, which fired case-shot
diagonally along the foot of the walls.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the French grenadiers pushed forward across the open
space towards the breach, under a rain of bullets from the 87th
which smote them on both flanks. The Fusiliers were firing fast and
accurately, to the tune of <i>Garry Owen</i>, which the regimental band
was playing by order of Gough just behind the breach, accompanied by
bursts of shouts and cheering. On arriving at the foot of the walls,
in great disorder, the French column hesitated for a moment; many men
began to fire instead of pressing on, but some bold spirits scaled the
rough slope of the breach and reached its lip—only to get a momentary
glimpse of the fourteen-foot drop behind it, and to fall dead.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span> The bulk of the column
then swerved away to its right, and fell upon the palisades and other
defences in front of the Portcullis tower, where the hasty repairs
made after the flood of the preceding night did not look effective.
Apparently many of the voltigeurs who had been already engaged in this
quarter joined in their assault, which surged over the outer barricades
and penetrated as far as the portcullis itself. It was found too well
repaired to be broken down, and the stormers, crowded in front of it,
and caught in an angle between the front wall defended by the 87th, and
the flanking Jesus tower from which the 47th were firing, found the
corner too hot for them, and suddenly recoiled and fled. The officer
at the head of the forlorn hope gave up his sword to Gough through the
bars of the portcullis, which alone separated them, and many other
men at the front of the column also surrendered, rather than face the
point-blank fire at close range which would have accompanied the first
stage of their retreat.</p>

<p>This was a striking instance of an assault on a very broad breach,
by a strong force, being beaten off by musketry fire alone. The French
seem never to have had a chance in face of the steady resistance of
the 87th and their comrades. Their loss is given by the official
French historian at only 48 killed and 159 wounded, which seems an
incredibly low figure when over 2,000 men were at close quarters with
the besieged, in a very disadvantageous position, for some time<a
id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. The
British lost 2 officers and 7 men killed, 3 officers, 2 sergeants,
and 22 men wounded: the Spaniards had a lieutenant-colonel killed
and about 20 men killed and wounded.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span></p> <p>The assault having failed so
disastrously, the spirits of the besiegers sank to a very low pitch.
The rain continued to fall during the whole day and the following
night, and the already water-logged trenches became quite untenable. On
New Year’s Day, 1812, the dawn showed a miserable state of affairs—not
only were the roads to the rear, towards Fascinas and Vejer, entirely
blocked by the swelling of mountain torrents, but communications were
cut even between the siege-camps. All the provision of powder in the
siege-batteries was found to be spoilt by wet, and a great part of
the cartridges of the infantry. Nearly a third of the horses of the
train had perished from cold combined with low feeding. No rations
were issued to the troops that day, and on the three preceding days
only incomplete ones had been given, because of the impossibility of
getting them up from the reserve dépôt, and many of the men wandered
without leave for three miles to the rear in search of food or
shelter. An exploring party of the 47th pushing out into the trenches
found them quite unguarded<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125"
class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and full of water. Leval wrote a formal
proposal for the abandonment of the siege to his chief, Victor, saying
that the only choice was to save the army by retreat, or to see it
perish in a few days if it remained stationary<a id="FNanchor_126"
href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. The Marshal, however,
refused to turn back from an enterprise in which he considered his
honour involved, and the tempest having abated on the night of Jan.
2nd-3rd, ordered the batteries and approaches to be remanned, and
directed that an attempt should be made to sap forward toward the Jesus
tower from the left advanced trenches. The work done was feeble—the
batteries had fired only fifty shots by evening, and the repairs to the
damaged works were very incomplete.</p>

<p>Even Victor’s obstinacy yielded, however, when on the night of the
3rd-4th January another furious storm arose, and once more stopped all
possibility of continuing operations. No food had now come up from the
base for many days, and the stores at the front being exhausted, the
Marshal saw that it was necessary to march at once. An attempt was
made to withdraw the guns from the batteries, but only one 12-pounder
and two howitzers were got off—the horses were so weak and the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span> ground so sodden that
even when 200 infantry were set to help, most of the pieces could not
be dragged more than a few yards. Wherefore the attempt was given over,
the powder in the batteries was thrown open to the rain, the balls
rolled into the Retiro ravine, the nine remaining heavy guns spiked.</p>

<p class="mt1">On the night of the 4th-5th the army crawled off on
the road to Vejer, abandoning nearly all its material in its camps.
An attempt was made to fire a mass of abandoned vehicles, but the
rain stopped it. Next morning the French were passing the defile of
Torre Peña, under the not very effective fire of an English frigate,
which kept as close to the shore as was possible on a very rough
day. The four guns from the battery at this point were brought on,
with much toil, and no wounded were abandoned. On the 6th the column
reached Tayvilla, where it found a convoy and 100 horses, which were
of inestimable value, for those with the field-force were completely
spent. Nevertheless the one 12-pounder brought off from Tarifa was
abandoned in the mud. On the 7th Vejer was reached, and the expedition
was at an end. The troops of Victor’s division, after a short rest,
went back to the Cadiz Lines, those of Leval’s division marched for
Xeres.</p>

<p>Thus ended the leaguer of Tarifa, which cost the besiegers about 500
lives, more by sickness than by casualties in the trenches. There were
also some deserters—fifteen Poles came over in a body and surrendered
to Captain Carroll on the 3rd<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, and other individuals stole in from time
to time. But the main loss to the French, beyond that of prestige, was
that the battalions which had formed part of the expeditionary force
were so tired out and war-worn, that for several weeks they continued
to fill the hospitals in the Lines with sick, and were incapable of
further active service. Wherefore Soult could not send any appreciable
detachment to help Suchet on the side of Valencia: the cavalry
brigade, which sacked Murcia on January 26 and killed La Carrera,<a
id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> was
his only contribution to the operations on the east side of Spain.
The field-force which might otherwise have accompanied Pierre Soult’s
cavalry raid had been used up in the Tarifa expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>Another
distraction had come upon Soult while the Tarifa expedition was
in progress. On December 27, six days after Victor and Leval
commenced the siege, General Hill had once more begun to move on
the Estremaduran side, after remaining quiescent for nearly two
months since the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos. His advance was a
diversion made by Wellington’s direct orders, with the purpose of
drawing Soult’s attention away from the pursuit of Ballasteros and
the molesting of Tarifa<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. It failed to achieve the latter purpose,
since the operations of Victor had gone so far, before Hill moved, that
the Marshal stood committed to the siege, and indeed only heard that
Hill was on the move after the assault of December 31st had been made
and beaten off. But it caused Soult to cut off all support from Victor,
to turn his small remaining reserves in the direction of Estremadura,
and to welcome as a relief, rather than to deplore as a disaster, the
return of the defeated expeditionary force to the Lines of Cadiz on
January 7th. For about that date Hill was pushing Drouet before him,
and the reserves from Seville were moving northwards, so that Soult
was pleased to learn that the 10,000 men from Tarifa had returned, and
that, in consequence of their reappearance, he could draw off more
men from the direction of Cadiz to replace the troops moved toward
Estremadura.</p>

<p>Hill crossed the Portuguese frontier north of the Guadiana on
December 27th, with his own division, Hamilton’s Portuguese, two
British cavalry brigades (those of Long and de Grey<a id="FNanchor_130"
href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>) and one of Portuguese
(4th and 10th regiments under J. Campbell of the former corps), or
about 12,000 men. The small remainder of his force<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> was left about Elvas,
to watch any possible movement of the French from the direction of
Badajoz. His objective was Merida, where it was known that Dombrouski,
with the greater part of the 5th French Division, was lying, in
a position far advanced from the main body of Drouet’s troops,
who were cantoned about Zafra and Llerena. There was some hope of
surprising this force, and a certainty of driving it in, and of
throwing Drouet and Soult into a state of alarm.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span> Wellington directed Hill to keep to the
desolate road north of the Guadiana, because a winter raid from this
direction would be the last thing expected by the enemy. He bade his
lieutenant keep a wary eye in the direction of Truxillo and Almaraz,
from which the divisions of Marmont’s army then in New Castile might
possibly descend upon his rear. But the warning turned out to be
superfluous, since, before Hill moved, Marmont had been forced by the
Emperor’s orders to detach his troops on the Tagus for the ruinous
expedition under Montbrun to Alicante.</p>

<p>Marching very rapidly Hill reached Albuquerque on the 27th, and La
Rocca, only twenty miles from Merida, on the 28th. On the next day<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> the
prospect of surprising Dombrouski came to an end by the merest of
chances. The French general had sent out that morning a small column
to raise requisitions of food in the villages on this road. A troop
of hussars at its head discovered Hill’s advanced cavalry, near Navas
de Membrillo, and alarmed the infantry, three companies of the 88th
regiment under a Captain Neveux, who formed up and began to retreat
hastily towards Merida. Hill sent two squadrons each of the 13th Light
Dragoons and 2nd Hussars of the King’s German Legion in pursuit, with
orders to head off and capture, if possible, these 400 men. The result
was a combat of the same sort as that of Barquilla in 1810, where
it had already been shown that steady infantry could not be ridden
down by cavalry save under very exceptional circumstances. Neveux,
seeing the dragoons hurrying forward, turned off the road, formed
his men in square, and made for a cork wood on a rising ground. The
cavalry overtook him, and delivered five determined charges, which
were all beaten off with heavy loss. We are told that their order
and impetus were both broken by scattered trees outside the wood,
but the main cause of their defeat was the impossibility of breaking
into a solidly-formed square of determined men, well commanded<a
id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.
After the final charge the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p.
132]</span> squadrons drew off, and Neveux hastened on through
the wood, fell back again into the road, and reached Merida,
though he lost a few men<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a> by shells from Hawker’s battery, which came
up late in the day. The K.G.L. Hussars had 2 men killed and 1 officer
and 17 men wounded: the 13th Light Dragoons 1 killed and 19 wounded.</p>

<p>Dombrouski, warned of the approach of the allies in force,
immediately evacuated Merida, where Hill made prize of 160,000 lb. of
wheat, unground, and a large magazine of biscuit. He found that the
French had been fortifying the town, but the works were too unfinished
to allow them to defend it. On January 1st Hill, continuing his
advance, marched across the bridge of Merida on Almendralejo, thinking
that Drouet might possibly have come up to help Dombrouski, and that
he might force him to fight. This was not to be: the rearguard of the
force from Merida was discovered drawn up in front of Almendralejo, but
gave way at the first push: a small magazine of food was captured in
the town.</p>

<p>It was now clear that Drouet did not intend to make a stand, but
would fall back towards the Andalusian frontier, and wait for aid from
Soult. Hill resolved to move his main body no further, but sent out
a small flying column under Major-General Abercrombie, with orders
to press the French rearguard as long as it would give way, but to
halt and turn back on finding serious forces in front of him. This
detachment (1/50th regiment, two squadrons 2nd Hussars K.G.L., two
squadrons 10th Portuguese, three guns) passing Fuente del Maestre
neared Los Santos on January 3rd, and found Dombrouski, with a
rearguard of all arms, disposed to fight. This led to a sharp cavalry
combat, between two squadrons of the 26th French Dragoons and the
allied horse. One squadron of the hussars and one of the Portuguese,
gallantly led by Colonel Campbell, charged the enemy in front, the
other squadrons remaining in reserve. The dragoons, soon broken, lost
6 killed, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>
wounded, and 2 officers and 35 men prisoners. Thereupon the French
infantry moved rapidly off southwards, making no attempt to stand. The
victors lost 1 man killed and 14 wounded from the hussars, 1 officer
and 5 men from the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Drouet was now concentrating at Llerena, and ready to give up all
Estremadura north of that point. He was sending daily appeals for
succour to Soult, who had little to give him, while Victor and the
expeditionary force were away at Tarifa. On January 5th the Duke of
Dalmatia wrote a dispatch which ordered that the siege should be
abandoned—but long ere it came to hand Victor had been forced to
depart, as we have seen, for reasons entirely unconnected with Hill’s
midwinter raid. Wellington’s plan would have worked if the weather had
not already driven Victor away, but had in actual fact no effect on his
proceedings.</p>

<p>Hill, having accomplished all that could be done in the way of
alarming Soult, held Merida and Almendralejo for a few days, with his
advanced cavalry about Fuente del Maestre: but retired on January 13th
to Albuquerque and Portalegre, to the intense relief of his enemy. The
raising of the siege of Tarifa being known, there was no further reason
for keeping Hill in an advanced position, which might have tempted
Soult to make a great concentration and take the offensive. Wellington
had no desire that he should do so, since the Army of Andalusia, while
dispersed, was harmless, but might become dangerous if it should
evacuate great regions, and so be able to collect in force. Soult did
not wish to make such sacrifices unless he were obliged, and on hearing
of Hill’s retreat countermanded all orders for concentration, and
contented himself with bringing back Drouet to Llerena and Zalamea, and
with reopening his communication with Badajoz, which had been cut while
the allies were at Fuente del Maestre. He did not at this time reoccupy
Merida, partly because the position had been demonstrated to be
dangerous by Hill’s recent raid, partly because its main importance was
that it covered the road to Truxillo and Almaraz and Marmont’s army.
But Marmont having, for the moment, no troops in this direction, owing
to the Alicante expedition, it was useless to try to keep in touch with
him.</p>

<p>Hill’s expedition, by driving Drouet for some time from the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> line of the Guadiana,
made possible a sudden irruption of the Spaniards into La Mancha,
where none of their regular troops had been since the battle of Ocaña
two years before. This raid was carried out by Morillo at the head
of a brigade of the Estremaduran army of Castaños. That general had
heard of the way in which the upper valley of the Guadiana had been
denuded of troops, in order that the Army of the Centre might assist
Suchet in the direction of Cuenca and Requeña<a id="FNanchor_135"
href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. Nothing was left in
La Mancha save a few battalions of King Joseph’s German Division, and
a brigade of Treillard’s dragoons, a force which could only provide
garrisons for a few large towns and watch the high-road from Madrid to
Andalusia. Morillo was directed to slip eastward through the gap made
by Hill between the Armies of the South and Portugal, to endeavour to
cut up the French posts, and to collect recruits and contributions
in the country-side. With luck he might even break the line of
communication between Soult and Madrid. His force of 3,000 men was
insufficient for anything more than a raid.</p>

<p>Starting from Montanches near Caçeres on December 30th—three days
after Hill’s expedition had begun—Morillo crossed the Guadiana, and
after making a fruitless dash at Belalcazar, the isolated French
garrison which protected the northernmost corner of Andalusia, marched
straight on by Agudo and Sarceruela into the heart of La Mancha, where
he seized Ciudad Real, its capital [January 15]. The small French force
quartered there fled at his approach, which was wholly unexpected—no
Spanish army had ever marched up the valley of the Guadiana before. On
the next day Morillo attacked Almagro, where there was a garrison of
500 men; but before he had made any impression he was surprised by the
arrival of General Treillard, with a column hastily gathered from the
posts along the high-road. The Spanish general refused to fight, and,
abandoning Ciudad Real, withdrew with little loss into the passes of
the Sierra de Guadalupe, where his enemy declined to follow. Since Hill
had by this time abandoned Merida and returned to Portugal, Morillo
felt his position to be uncomfortably isolated, and feared that French
troops from Estremadura or from the Tagus valley might intercept his
way home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>ward.
The danger turned out to be imaginary, and on reaching Truxillo on
January 30 the column was able to rest unmolested for a fortnight at
that important strategical point, and then to retire at leisure to
Montanches, its original starting-point.</p>

<p>Thus ended an extraordinary raid, which, though it had no positive
results whatever, demonstrated two things clearly enough—one was the
marching power of the Spanish infantry, which between December 28
and January 30 covered 250 miles of vile mountain roads in bitter
weather, and came back intact with little loss<a id="FNanchor_136"
href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, the other was the
slightness of the French hold on La Mancha, where the appearance of a
small brigade of 3,000 men upset the whole country-side. Morillo was
only driven off by a concentration of many small garrisons, and, when
they were withdrawn, the local guerrillero bands overran the land.
Their chiefs, El Medico [Palarea], Chaleco, and others, did an immense
amount of damage while the French were concentrated, and ravaged up
to the very gates of Madrid. Chaos reigned in New Castile till Foy’s
and Sarrut’s divisions came back from the Alicante expedition, and
dispersed themselves along the valley of the Tagus at the beginning of
February. For, as we have often had occasion to remark before, every
province of Spain required not only to be conquered but to be held
down by a permanent garrison. The moment that it was left too lightly
held, the guerrilleros came down from the hills, occupied all the open
country, and cut all communications.</p>

  <p class="subh3">POLITICS AT CADIZ AND ELSEWHERE</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> military operations in the South
during the winter of 1811-12 were inconclusive, and only important in
a negative way, as showing that the initiative of the French armies
was spent in this direction. But it must not be forgotten that while
Soult had been brought to a standstill, Suchet’s operations were still
progressing: January, indeed, saw the last great Spanish disaster
of the war, the fall of Valencia, so that the spirits of government
and people still ran very low. It was not till the sudden irruption
of Wellington into the kingdom of Leon had ended in the capture of
Ciudad Rodrigo (January 19), that there was any great occasion for
hopefulness. And for a long time after that event its importance was
not fully understood. That the central turning-point of the war had
come, that for the future the allies were to be on the offensive, and
the French on the defensive, was not realized till Badajoz had fallen
in April, a blow which shook the whole fabric of King Joseph’s power
throughout the regions where he seemed to reign. Nor was it only the
state of affairs in the Peninsula which, during the winter of 1811-12,
seemed sufficiently gloomy both for the present and for the future.
The news from the Spanish colonies in America grew steadily worse: in
most of the viceroyalties of the Western world there was now a nucleus
of trouble: the name of Ferdinand VII was still used by the insurgents
as a rallying cry, except in Venezuela, where Miranda had proclaimed
an independent republic in July 1811. But in La Plata and Chili
lip-loyalty to the sovereign was accompanied by practical secession
from the Spanish state: the <i>Cabildos</i> or Juntas paid no attention
to orders received from Cadiz. In Mexico, though the capital and the
greater part of the country were still in the hands of the constituted
authorities, there was a lively insurrection on foot since September
1810, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>
priest Hidalgo—he was captured and executed in 1812, but his death
did not crush his faction. The Viceroyalty of Peru was almost the
only part of Spanish America which still remained loyal. The Cortes
at Cadiz made elaborate attempts to conciliate the Americans, but was
unable to satisfy their expectations or to end their discontents. The
deeply-rooted belief of the Creoles that they and their country were
still being exploited for the benefit of Spain, could not be removed
by any declaration that they were now to be Spanish citizens with full
rights, or by giving them representation in the Cortes. The idea of
autonomy was already abroad in Spanish America, and in every quarter
ambitious men were quoting the precedent of the revolt of the Thirteen
United Colonies from Great Britain in the previous generation. Truly
Spain had committed an unwise act when she joined France in wrecking
the British domination in North America. She revenged an old grudge
successfully, but she taught her own colonists a lesson impossible to
forget and easy to copy.</p>

<p>The Peninsular War had hitherto been maintained in no small degree
by the money which kept flowing in from America: what would happen if
the treasure-ships with their regular supply of silver dollars from the
mines of Mexico and Peru ceased altogether to come in? Already affairs
were looking so threatening that, despite of all the needs of the
campaign at home, reinforcements were being sent out to the New World
from Cadiz and from Corunna: the Army of Galicia, as we shall presently
see, was nearly put out of action in the spring of 1812 by the dispatch
of an over-great proportion of its trained artillerymen to America<a
id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. Some
French observers of the situation formed the idea that the Spaniards,
if pressed to a decision between the possible loss of their colonies
and the chance of obtaining a free hand by peace with Napoleon, might
make the choice for empire rather than freedom. By acknowledging Joseph
Bonaparte as king, and coming into the Napoleonic system, they might be
able to turn their whole strength against the discontented Americans.
This idea had one fatal error: any Spaniard could see that submission
to France meant war with Great Britain: and then the way across
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> Atlantic would
be closed. The British government would be forced into an alliance with
the colonists; it had already thought of this device in the old days
before Napoleon’s invasion of the Peninsula. Whitelock’s unhappy Buenos
Ayres expedition in 1807 had been sent out precisely to take advantage
of the discontent of the Americans, and in the hope that they would
rise against the mother country if promised assistance. The adventurer
Miranda had spent much time in pressing this policy on the Portland
cabinet. Whitelock’s descent on the Rio de la Plata, it is true, had
been as disappointing in the political as in the military line: he had
got no help whatever from the disaffected colonists. But feeling in
America had developed into much greater bitterness since 1807: in 1812
actual insurrection had already broken out. British aid would not, this
time, be rejected: the malcontents would buy it by the grant of liberal
trading concessions, which the Cadiz government, even in its worst time
of trouble, had steadily refused to grant. There was every chance,
therefore, that a policy of submission to Napoleon would ensure the
loss of America even more certainly and more rapidly than a persistence
in the present war. It does not seem that any person of importance at
Cadiz ever took into serious consideration the idea of throwing up
the struggle for independence, in order to obtain the opportunity of
dealing with the American question.</p>

<p>The idea, however, was in the air. This was the time at which
King Joseph made his last attempt to open up secret negotiation with
the patriots. His own condition was unhappy enough, as has been
sufficiently shown in an earlier chapter: but he was well aware that
the outlook of his enemies was no less gloomy. One of the numerous—and
usually impracticable—pieces of advice which his brother had sent him
was the suggestion that he should assemble some sort of a Cortes, and
then, posing as a national king, try to open up communications with
the Cadiz government, setting forth the somewhat unconvincing thesis
that Great Britain, and not France, was the real enemy of Spanish
greatness. The idea of calling a Cortes fell through: the individuals
whom Joseph could have induced to sit in it would have been so few,
so insignificant, and so unpopular, that such a body could only have
provoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> contempt<a
id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.
But an attempt was made to see if anything could be done at Cadiz:
the inducement which Joseph was authorized to offer to the patriots
was that immediately on his recognition as a constitutional king
by the Cortes—and a constitution was to be drawn up in haste at
Madrid—the French army should retire from Spain, and the integrity
of the realm should be guaranteed. Napoleon even made a half-promise
to give up Catalonia, though he had practically annexed it to his
empire in the previous year<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139"
class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.</p>

<p>Joseph and his ministers had no confidence either in the Emperor’s
sincerity in making these offers, or in the likelihood of their
finding any acceptance among the patriots. He sent, however, to Cadiz
as his agent a certain Canon La Peña, a secret <i>Afrancesado</i>, but a
brother of Manuel La Peña, the incapable general who had betrayed
Graham at Barrosa. This officer was on his trial at the moment for his
misbehaviour on that occasion, and the canon pretended to have come
to assist him in his day of trouble on grounds of family affection.
It would seem that he sounded certain persons but with small effect.
Toreno, who was present in Cadiz at the time, and well acquainted
with every intrigue that was in progress, says that the Regency never
heard of the matter, and that very few members of the Cortes knew what
La Peña was doing. It seems that he had conversations with certain
freemasons, who were connected with lodges in Madrid that were under
French influence, and apparently with one member of the ministry.
‘I do not give his name,’ says the historian, ‘because I have no
documentary proof to bear out the charge, but moral proof I have<a
id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.’ Be
this as it may, the labours of La Peña do not seem to have been very
fruitful, and the assertion made by certain French historians, and by
Napoleon himself in the <i>Mémorial de Ste-Hélène</i>, that the Cortes would
have proceeded to treat with Joseph, but for Wellington’s astonishing
successes in the spring of 1812, has little or no foundation. As Toreno
truly observes, any open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p.
140]</span> proposal of the sort would have resulted in the tearing to
pieces by the populace of the man hardy enough to make it. The intrigue
had no more success than the earlier mission of Sotelo, which has been
spoken of in another place<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141"
class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. But it lingered on, till the battle of
Salamanca in July, and the flight of Joseph from Madrid in August,
proved, to any doubters that there may have been, that the French
cause was on the wane<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142"
class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. One of the most curious results of this
secret negotiation was that Soult, hearing that the King’s emissary was
busy at Cadiz, and not knowing that it was at Napoleon’s own suggestion
that the experiment was being made, came to the conclusion that Joseph
was plotting to abandon his brother, and to make a private peace with
the Cortes, on condition that he should break with France and be
recognized as king. He wrote, as we shall presently see, to denounce
him to Napoleon as a traitor. Hence came no small friction in the
following autumn.</p>

<p>These secret intrigues fell into a time of keen political strife at
Cadiz—the famous Constitution, which was to cause so much bickering
in later years, was being drafted, discussed, and passed through the
Cortes in sections, all through the autumn of 1811 and the winter of
1811-12. The Liberals and the Serviles fought bitterly over almost
every clause, and during their disputes the anti-national propaganda of
the handful of <i>Afrancesados</i> passed almost unnoticed. It is impossible
in a purely military history to relate the whole struggle, and a few
words as to its political bearings must suffice.</p>

<p>The Constitution was a strange amalgam of ancient Spanish national
tradition, of half-understood loans from Great Britain and America,
and of political theory borrowed from France. Many of its framers
had obviously studied the details of the abortive ‘limited monarchy’
which had been imposed on Louis XVI in the early days of the French
Revolution. From this source came the scheme which limited within
narrow bounds the sovereign’s power in the Constitution. The system
evolved was that of a king whose main constitutional weapon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> was that right of veto on
legislation which had proved so unpopular in France. He was to choose
ministers who, like those of the United States of America, were not to
sit in parliament, nor to be necessarily dependent on a party majority
in the house, though they were to be responsible to it. There was to be
but one Chamber, elected not directly by the people—though universal
suffrage was introduced—but by notables chosen by the parishes in local
primary assemblies, who again named district notables, these last
nominating the actual members for the Cortes.</p>

<p>The right of taxation was vested in the Chamber, and the Ministry
was placed at its mercy by the power of refusing supply. The regular
army was specially subjected to the Chamber and not to the King, though
the latter was left some power with regard to calling out or disbanding
the local militia which was to form the second line in the national
forces—at present it was in fact non-existent, unless the guerrillero
bands might be considered to represent it.</p>

<p>The most cruel blows were struck not only at the King’s power but
at his prestige. A clause stating that all treaties or grants made by
him while in captivity were null and void was no doubt necessary—there
was no knowing what documents Napoleon might not dictate to Ferdinand.
But it was unwise to formulate in a trenchant epigram that ‘the nation
is free and independent, not the patrimony of any family or person,’
or that ‘the people’s obligation of obedience ceases when the King
violates the laws.’ And when, after granting their sovereign a veto on
legislation, the Constitution proceeded to state that the veto became
inoperative after the Cortes had passed any act in three successive
sessions, it became evident that the King’s sole weapon was to be made
ineffective. ‘Sovereignty,’ it was stated, ‘is vested essentially in
the nation, and for this reason the nation alone has the right to
establish its fundamental laws.’ But the most extraordinary attack on
the principle of legitimate monarchy was a highhanded resettlement of
the succession to the throne, in which the regular sequence of next
heirs was absolutely ignored. If King Ferdinand failed to leave issue,
the crown was to go to his brother Don Carlos: if that prince also died
childless, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>
Constitution declared that the infante Don Francisco and his sister
the Queen of Etruria were both to be passed over. No definite reasons
were given in the act of settlement for this astonishing departure
from the natural line of descent. The real meaning of the clause
concerning Don Francisco was that many suspected him of being the son
of Godoy and not of Charles IV<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. As to the Queen of Etruria, she had been in
her younger days a docile tool of Napoleon, and had lent herself very
tamely to his schemes. But it is said that the governing cause of her
exclusion from the succession was not so much her own unpopularity, as
the incessant intrigues of her sister Carlotta, the wife of the regent
João of Portugal, who had for a long time been engaged in putting
forward a claim to be elected as sole regent of Spain. She had many
members of the Cortes in her pay, and their influence was directed to
getting her name inserted in the list above that of her brother in
the succession-roll, and to the disinheritance of her sister also.
Her chance of ever reaching the throne was not a very good one, as
both Ferdinand and Carlos were still young, and could hardly be kept
prisoners at Valençay for ever. It is probable that the real object of
the manœvres was rather to place her nearer to the regency of Spain in
the present crisis, than to seat her upon its throne at some remote
date. For the regency was her desire, though the crown too would have
been welcome, and sometimes not only the anti-Portuguese party in the
Cortes, but Wellington and his brother Henry Wellesley, the Ambassador
at Cadiz, were afraid that by patience and by long intrigue her
partisans might achieve their object.</p>

<p>Wellington was strongly of opinion that a royal regent at Cadiz
would be most undesirable. The personal influences of a <i>camarilla</i>,
surrounding an ambitious but incapable female regent, would add another
difficulty to the numerous problems of the relations between England
and Spain, which were already sufficiently tiresome.</p>

<p>This deliberate humiliation of the monarchy, by clauses accentuated
by phrases of insult, which angered, and were intended to anger, the
<i>Serviles</i>, was only accomplished after long debate, in which protests
of the most vigorous sort were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p.
143]</span> made by many partisans of the old theory of Spanish
absolutism. Some spoke in praise of the Salic Law, violated by the
mention of Carlotta as heiress to the throne, others (ignoring
rumours as to his paternity) defended Don Francisco, as having been
by his youth exempted from the ignominies of Bayonne, and dwelt on
the injustice of his fate. But the vote went against them by a most
conclusive figure.</p>

<p>The majority in the Cortes, which made such parade of its political
liberalism, did not pursue its theories into the realm of religion.
After reading its fulsome declarations in favour of freedom, it is
astounding to note the black intolerance of the clause which declares
not only, as might naturally be expected, that ‘the religion of the
Spanish nation is, and ever shall be, the Catholic Apostolic Roman,
the one true faith,’ but that ‘the nation defends it by wise laws,
<i>forbidding the exercise of any other</i>.’ Schism and unorthodoxy still
remained political as well as ecclesiastical crimes, no less than
in the time of Philip II. The Liberals, despite of murmurs by the
<i>Serviles</i>, refused to recreate the Inquisition, but this was as far as
their conception of religious freedom went.</p>

<p>Contemplating this exhibition of mediaeval intolerance, it is
impossible to rate at any very high figure the ostentatious liberalism
which pervades the greater part of the Constitution. We are bound to
recognize in it merely the work of a party of ambitious politicians,
who desired to secure control of the state-machine for themselves,
and to exclude the monarchy from all share in its manipulation. No
doubt any form of limited government was better than the old royal
bureaucracy. But this particular scheme went much farther than the
needs or the possibilities of the time, and was most unsuited for
a country such as the Spain of 1812. When its meaning began to be
understood in the provinces, it commanded no enthusiasm or respect.
Indeed, outside the Cortes itself the only supporters that it
possessed were the populace of Cadiz and a few other great maritime
towns. Considered as a working scheme it had the gravest faults,
especially the ill-arranged relations between the ministers (who
did not form a real cabinet) and the Chamber, in which they were
prohibited from sitting. In 1814 Lord Castlereagh observed, with great
truth, that he could now say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p.
144]</span> from certain experience, that in practice as well as in
theory the Constitution of 1812 was one of the worst among the modern
productions of its kind<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144"
class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the many by-products of the Constitution was a change in
the membership of the Regency. The old ‘trinitarian’ body composed
of Blake, Agar, and Cisgar, had long been discredited, and proposals
for its dissolution had been debated, even before its further
continuance was rendered impossible by Blake’s surrender to the French
at Valencia in the earliest days of 1812. A furious discussion in
the Cortes had ended in a vote that no royal personage should be a
member of any new regency, so that the pretensions of the Princess
of Portugal were finally discomfited. The new board consisted of the
Duke of Infantado, Joaquim Mosquera, a member of the Council of the
Indies, Admiral Villavicencio, military governor of Cadiz, Ignacio
Rodriguez de Rivas, and Henry O’Donnell, Conde de la Bispal, the
energetic soldier whose exploits in Catalonia have been set forth
in the last volume of this book. He was the only man of mark in the
new regency: Infantado owed his promotion to his rank and wealth,
and the fact that he had been the trusted friend of Ferdinand VII.
He possessed a limited intelligence and little education, and was
hardly more than a cipher, with a distinct preference for ‘Serviles’
rather than for Liberals. Villavicencio had no military reputation,
but had been an energetic organizer, and a fairly successful governor
during the siege of Cadiz. Mosquera and Rivas were elected mainly
because they were of American birth—their choice was intended to
conciliate the discontented colonists. Neither of them was entitled
by any great personal merit to the promotion which was thrust upon
him. Henry O’Donnell, now at last recovered from the wound which had
laid him on a sick bed for so many months in 1811<a id="FNanchor_145"
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, was both capable and
energetic, but quarrelsome and provocative: he belonged to that class
of men who always irritate their colleagues<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> into opposition, by their rapid decisions
and imperious ways, especially when those colleagues are men of ability
inferior to their own. The Duke of Infantado was absent for some time
after his election—he had been serving as ambassador in London. Of
the other four Regents two ranked as ‘Serviles,’ two as Liberals, a
fact which told against their efficiency as a board. They had little
strength to stand out against the Cortes, whose jealousy against any
power in the State save its own was intense. On the whole it may be
said that the substitution of the five new Regents for the three old
ones had no great political consequences. The destiny of the patriot
cause was not in the hands of the executive, but of the turbulent,
faction-ridden, and ambitious legislative chamber, an ideally
bad instrument for the conduct of a difficult and dangerous war.
Fortunately it was neither the Regency nor the Cortes whose actions
were to settle the fate of the campaign of 1812, but purely and solely
Wellington and the Anglo-Portuguese army. The intrigues of Cadiz turned
out to be a negligible quantity in the course of events.</p>

<p>In Lisbon at this time matters were much more quiet than they had
been a little while back. The Portuguese government had abandoned any
overt opposition to Wellington, such as had been seen in 1810, when
the Patriarch and the President Souza had given him so much trouble.
The expulsion of Masséna from Portugal had justified the policy of
Wellington, and almost silenced his critics. He had not even found
it necessary to press for the removal of the men whom he distrusted
from the Council of Regency<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, in which the word of his loyal coadjutor,
Charles Stuart, who combined the rather incompatible functions of
British Ambassador and Regent, was now supreme. Open opposition had
ceased, but Wellington complained that while compliance was always
promised, ‘every measure which I propose is frittered away to nothing,
the form and the words remain, but the spirit of the measure is
taken away in the execution<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.’ This was, he remarked, the policy of the
Portuguese government: they no longer refused him anything; but<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> if they thought that any
of his demands might offend either the Prince Regent at Rio Janeiro or
the popular sentiment of the Portuguese nation, they carried out his
proposals in such a dilatory fashion, and with so many exceptions and
excuses, that he failed to obtain what he had expected.</p>

<p>In this there was a good deal of injustice. Wellington does not
always seem to have realized the abject poverty which four years of
war had brought upon Portugal. The Regency calculated that, on account
of falling revenue caused by the late French invasion, for 1812
they could only count on 12,000,000 <i>cruzados novos</i> of receipts<a
id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>—this
silver coin was worth about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> sterling, so that the total
amounted to about £1,500,000. Of this three-fourths, or 9,000,000
cruzados, was set aside for the army, the remainder having to sustain
all the other expenses of the State—justice, civil administration,
roads, navy, &amp;c. The British subsidy had been raised to £2,000,000
a year, but it was paid with the utmost irregularity: in one month
of 1811 the Portuguese treasury had received only £6,000, in another
only £20,000, instead of the £166,000 promised<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. When such arrears
accumulated, it was no wonder that the soldiers starved and the
magazines ran low. It was calculated that to keep the army up to
its full numbers, and to supply all military needs efficiently,
45,000,000 cruzados a year were required. Taking the British subsidy
as equalling 16,000,000, and the available national contribution at
9,000,000 cruzados, there was little more than half the required sum
available. This Portuguese calculation appears to be borne out by the
note of Beresford’s chief of the staff, D’Urban, in February 1812. ‘The
Marshal at Lisbon finds that, after a perfect investigation, it appears
that the expenditure must be nearly £6,000,000—the means at present
£3,500,000! <i>Nous verrons.</i>’</p>

<p>It is clear that the Portuguese government must have shrunk from
many of Wellington’s suggestions on account of mere lack<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> of resources. A third
of the country had been at one time or another overrun by the
French—the provinces north of the Douro in 1809, the Beira and northern
Estremadura in 1810-11. It would take long years before they were in
a position to make their former contributions to the expenses of the
State. It was impossible to get over this hard fact: but Wellington
thought that a rearrangement of taxes, and an honest administration
of their levy, would produce a much larger annual revenue than was
being raised in 1812. He pointed out, with some plausibility, that
British money was being poured into Portugal by millions and stopped
there: some one—the merchant and contractor for the most part—must be
making enormous profits and accumulating untold wealth. Moreover he
had discovered cases of the easy handling of the rich and influential
in the matter of taxation, while the peasantry were being drained
of their last farthing. Such little jobs were certain to occur in
an administration of the <i>ancien régime</i>: fidalgos and capitalists
knew how to square matters with officials at Lisbon. ‘A reform in the
abuses of the Customs of Lisbon and Oporto, a more equal and just
collection of the Income Tax on commercial property, particularly in
those large and rich towns [it is scandalous to hear of the fortunes
made by the mercantile classes owing to the war, and to reflect that
they contribute practically nothing to bear its burdens], a reform of
the naval establishment and the arsenal, would make the income equal
to the expenditure, and the government would get on without calling
upon Great Britain at every moment to find that which, in the existing
state of the world, cannot be procured, viz. money<a id="FNanchor_150"
href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.’ So wrote Wellington,
who was always being irritated by discovering that the magazines of
Elvas or Almeida were running low, or that recruits were not rejoining
their battalions because there was no cash to arm or clothe them, or
that troops in the field were getting half-rations, unless they were on
the British subsidy list.</p>

<p>No doubt Wellington was right in saying that there was a certain
amount of jobbery in the distribution of taxation, and that more could
have been raised by a better system. But Portuguese figures of the time
seem to make it clear that even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p.
148]</span> if a supernatural genius had been administering the
revenue instead of the Conde de Redondo, all could not have been
obtained that was demanded. The burden of the war expenses was too
heavy for an impoverished country, with no more than two and a half
million inhabitants, which was compelled to import a great part of
its provisions owing to the stress of war. The state of Portugal may
be estimated by the fact that in the twelve months between February
1811 and January 1812 £2,672,000 worth of imported corn, besides
605,000 barrels of flour, valued at £2,051,780 more, was brought into
the country and sold there<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. On the other hand the export of wine, with
which Portugal used to pay for its foreign purchases, had fallen off
terribly: in 1811 only 18,000 pipes were sold as against an average of
40,000 for the eight years before the outbreak of the Peninsular War.
An intelligent observer wrote in 1812 that the commercial distress of
the country might mainly be traced to the fact that nearly all the
money which came into the country from England, great as was the sum,
found its way to the countries from which Portugal was drawing food,
mainly to the United States, from which the largest share of the wheat
and flour was brought. ‘As we have no corresponding trade with America,
the balance has been very great against this country: for the last
three years this expenditure has been very considerable, without any
return whatever, as the money carried to America has been completely
withdrawn from circulation.’</p>

<p>The shrinkage in the amount of the gold and silver current in
Portugal was as noticeable in these years as the same phenomenon in
England, and (like the British) the Portuguese government tried to
make up the deficiency by the issue of inconvertible paper money,
which gradually fell in exchange value as compared with the metallic
currency. The officers of the army, as well as all civil functionaries,
were paid their salaries half in cash and half in notes—the latter
suffered a depreciation of from 15 to 30 per cent. Among the cares
which weighed on Wellington and Charles Stuart was that of endeavouring
to keep the Regency from the easy expedient of issuing more and more
of a paper currency which was already circulating at far less than its
face value. This was avoided—fortunately for the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span> Portuguese people and army, no less than
for the Anglo-Portuguese alliance.</p>

<p>After all, the practical results of the efforts made by the
Portuguese government were invaluable. Wellington could not have held
his ground, much less have undertaken the offensive campaign of 1812,
without the aid of the trusty auxiliaries that swelled his divisions to
normal size. Without their Portuguese brigades most of them would have
been mere skeletons of 3,000 or 4,000 men. Beresford’s army was almost
up to its full establishment in January 1812—there were 59,122 men on
the rolls, when recruits, sick, men on detachment, and the regiment
lent for the succour of Cadiz are all counted. Deducting, beyond
these, the garrisons of Elvas, Abrantes, Almeida, and smaller places,
as also the dismounted cavalry left in the rear<a id="FNanchor_152"
href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>, there were over 30,000
men for the fighting-line, in ten brigades of infantry, six regiments
of cavalry, and eight field-batteries. Beresford, lately entrusted
by orders from Rio Janeiro with still more stringent powers over the
military establishment, was using them to the full. An iron hand kept
down desertion and marauding, executions for each of those offences
appear incessantly in the <i>Ordens do Dia</i>, which give the daily
chronicle of the Portuguese head-quarters. In addition to the regular
army it must be remembered that he had to manage the militia, of which
as many as 52,000 men were under arms at one time or another in 1812.
Counting the first and the second line together, there were 110,000 men
enrolled—a fine total for a people of two and a half million souls.</p>

<p>Putting purely Portuguese difficulties aside, Wellington was much
worried at this time by a trouble which concerned the British and not
the local finances. This was the delay in the cashing of the ‘<i>vales</i>’
or bills for payment issued by the Commissary-General for food and
forage bought from the peasantry. As long as they were settled at short
intervals, no difficulty arose about them—they were indeed treated
as negotiable paper, and had passed from hand to hand at a lesser
discount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> than the
inconvertible Portuguese government papers. But all through the year
1811 the interval between the issue of the ‘<i>vale</i>’ and its payment in
cash at Lisbon had been growing longer, and an uncomfortable feeling
was beginning to spread about the country-side. The peasantry were
growing suspicious, and were commencing to sell the bills, for much
less than their face value, to speculators who could afford to wait
for payment. To recoup themselves for their loss they were showing
signs of raising prices all round. Fortunately they were a simple
race, and communication between districts was slow and uncertain,
so that no general tendency of this sort was yet prevalent, though
the symptoms were making themselves visible here and there. Hence
came Wellington’s constant applications for more cash from England
at shorter notice. Late in the spring he devised a scheme by which
interest at 5 per cent. was to be paid by the Commissary-General on
bonds or certificates representing money or money’s worth advanced
to the British army, till the principal was repaid—two years being
named as the period after which the whole sum must be refunded. This
was a desperate measure, an endeavour to throw forward payment on to
a remote future, ‘when it is not probable that there will be the same
difficulty in procuring specie in England to send abroad as there is at
the present moment.’ The plan<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153"
class="fnanchor">[153]</a> was never tried, and was not good: for how
could small creditors of the English army be expected to stand out of
their money—representing the price of their crops or their cattle—for
so long a period as two years, even if they were, in the meantime,
receiving interest on what was really their working capital? Wellington
himself remarked, when broaching the scheme to Lord Liverpool, that
there remained the difficulty that no one could look forward, and
say that the British army would still be in the Peninsula two years
hence. If it had left Portugal—whether victorious and pushing towards
the Pyrenees, or defeated and driven back on to Great Britain—how
would the creditors communicate with the Commissary-General, their
debtor? They could only be referred to London, to which they would
have no ready access: indeed many of them would<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> not know where, or what, London was. That
such an idea should have been set forward only shows the desperate
financial situation of the British army.</p>

<p>We shall have to be referring to this problem at several later
points of the history of the campaign of 1812<a id="FNanchor_154"
href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>: at the opening of
the invasion of Leon in June it reached its worst point, just before
the great victory of Salamanca. But it was always present, and
when Wellington’s mind was not occupied with deductions as to the
manœuvres of French marshals, it may undoubtedly be said that his
main preoccupation was the normally depleted state of the military
chest, into which dollars and guineas flowed, it is true, in enormous
quantities, but only to be paid out at once, in settling arrears many
months old. These were never fully liquidated, and began to accumulate
again, with distressing rapidity, after every tardy settlement.</p>

<p>Whig historians have often tried to represent Wellington’s financial
difficulties as the fault of the home government, and it is easy to
pick passages from his dispatches in which he seems to assert that
he is not being supported according to his necessities. But a nearer
investigation of the facts will not bear out this easy theory, the
product of party spite. The Whigs of 1811-12 were occupied in decrying
the Peninsular War as a failure, in minimizing the successes of
Wellington, and in complaining that the vast sums of money lavished on
his army were wasted. Napoleon was invincible, peace was the only way
out of disaster, even if the peace must be somewhat humiliating. It
was unseemly for their representatives, twenty years after, to taunt
the Perceval and Liverpool ministries with having stinted Wellington
in his hour of need. We have learnt to estimate at their proper
value tirades against ‘the administration which was characterized
by all the corruption and tyranny of Mr. Pitt’s system, without his
redeeming genius.’ We no longer think that the Napoleonic War was waged
‘to repress the democratic principle,’ nor that the cabinets which
maintained it were ‘the rapacious usurpers of the people’s rights<a
id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span></p> <p>Rather,
in the spirit of Mr. Fortescue’s admirable volume on <i>British Statesmen
of the Great War</i>, shall we be prone to stand amazed at the courage
and resolution of the group of British ministers who stood out, for
long years and against tremendous odds, to defeat the tyrant of Europe
and to preserve the British Empire. ‘On the one side was Napoleon,
an autocrat vested with such powers as great genius and good fortune
have rarely placed in the hands of one man, with the resources of half
Europe at his disposition, and an armed force unsurpassed in strength
and devotion ready to march to the ends of the world to uphold his
will. On the other were these plain English gentlemen, with not so much
as a force of police at their back, with a population by nature five
times as turbulent as it is now, and in the manufacturing districts
inflamed alike by revolutionary teaching and by real distress, with
an Ireland always perilously near revolt, with a House of Commons
unreformed indeed, but not on that account containing a less factious,
mischievous, and obstructive opposition than any other House of Commons
during a great war. In face of all these difficulties they had to
raise armies, maintain fleets, construct and pursue a military policy,
and be unsuccessful at their peril. Napoleon might lose whole armies
with impunity: five thousand British soldiers beaten and captured
would have brought any British minister’s head perilously near the
block. Such were the difficulties that confronted Perceval, Liverpool,
and Castlereagh: yet for their country’s sake they encountered
them without flinching<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"
class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.’</p>

<p>The winter of 1811-12 was not quite the darkest hour: the Russian
war was looming in the near future, and Napoleon was already beginning
to withdraw troops from Spain in preparation for it. No longer
therefore, as in 1810 and the earlier half of 1811, was there a high
probability that the main bulk of the French armies, under the Emperor
himself, might be turned once more against the Peninsula. It was
all but certain that England would soon have allies, and not stand
practically alone in the struggle, as she had done ever since Wagram.
Nevertheless, even with the political horizon somewhat brightened in
the East, the time was a sufficiently anxious<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span> one. In Great Britain, as in the rest of
Europe, the harvest of 1811 had been exceptionally bad, and the high
price of bread, coinciding with much unemployment, was causing not only
distress but wide-spread turbulence in the manufacturing districts.
This was the year of the first outbreak of the ‘Luddites,’ and of their
senseless exploits in the way of machine-smashing. The worst stringency
of domestic troubles coincided with the gradual disappearance of the
external danger from the ambition of Napoleon.</p>

<p>In addition it must be remembered that the Perceval cabinet, on
which all the responsibilities fell, was by no means firmly established
in power. When it first took office many politicians believed that it
could not last for a single year. All through 1811 the Prince Regent
had been in secret negotiation with the Whigs, and would gladly have
replaced his ministers with some sort of a coalition government. And
in January 1812 Lord Wellesley, by far the most distinguished man in
the cabinet, resigned his post as Foreign Minister. He asserted that
he did so because his colleagues had failed to accept all his plans
for the support of his brother and the Peninsular army: and no doubt
this was to a certain extent true. Yet it cannot be said that, either
before or after his resignation, the Ministry had neglected Wellington;
in 1811 they had doubled his force of cavalry, and sent him about a
dozen new battalions of infantry. It was these reinforcements which
made the victories of 1812 possible, and in that year the stream
of reinforcements did not cease—nine more infantry regiments came
out, mostly in time for the great crisis in June<a id="FNanchor_157"
href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. In the autumn the
dispatch of further succours had become difficult, because of the
outbreak of the American war, which diverted of necessity to Canada
many units that might otherwise have gone to Spain. It is impossible to
maintain that Wellington was stinted of men: money was the difficulty.
And even as regards money—which had to be gold or silver, since paper
was useless in the Peninsula—the resources placed at his disposal were
much larger than in previous years, though not so large as he demanded,
nor as the growing scale of the war required.</p>

<p>It is difficult to acquit Wellesley of factiousness with
regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> to his
resignation, and the most damaging document against him is the
<i>apologia</i> drawn up by his devoted adherent Shawe<a id="FNanchor_158"
href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, in the belief that
it afforded a complete justification for his conduct: many of the
words and phrases are the Marquess’s own. From this paper no one can
fail to deduce that it was not so much a quixotic devotion to his
brother’s interests, as an immoderate conception of his own dignity
and importance that made Wellesley resign. He could not stand the free
discussion and criticism of plans and policies which is essential in
a cabinet. ‘Lord Wellesley has always complained, with some justice,
that his suggestions were received as those of a mere novice.... His
opinions were overruled, and the opposition he met with could only
proceed from jealousy, or from a real contempt for his judgement.
It seemed to him that they were unwilling to adopt any plan of his,
lest it might lead to his assuming a general ascendancy in the
Cabinet.... He said that he took another view of the situation: the
Government derived the most essential support from his joining it,
because it was considered as a pledge that the war would be properly
supported.... “The war is popular, and any government that will
support Lord Wellington properly will stand. I do not think the war
is properly supported, and I cannot, as an honest man, deceive the
nation by remaining in office.” ... It is needless to particularize all
the points of difference between Lord Wellesley and his colleagues:
Spain was the main point, but he also disapproved of their obstinate
adherence to the Orders in Council, and their policy towards America
and in Sicily’—not to speak of Catholic Emancipation.</p>

<p>These are the words of injured pride, not of patriotism. The
essential thing at the moment was that the war in Spain should be
kept up efficiently. By resigning, Wellesley intended to break up the
Ministry, and of this a probable result might have been the return to
office of the Whigs, whose policy was to abandon the Peninsula and
make peace with Napoleon. Wellesley’s <i>apologia</i> acknowledges that
his influence in the Cabinet had brought about, on more occasions
than one, an increase of the support given to his brother, e.g. his
colleagues had given in about additions to the Portuguese subsidy,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span> about extra
reinforcements to the army. This being so, it was surely criminal in
him to retire, when he found that some of his further suggestions were
not followed. Would the wrecking of the Perceval cabinet, and the
succession of the Whigs to power, have served Wellington or the general
cause of the British Empire?</p>

<p>Wellington himself saw the situation with clear eyes, and in a
letter, in which a touch of his sardonic humour can be detected,
wrote in reply to his brother’s announcement of his resignation that
‘In truth the republic of a cabinet is but little suited to any man
of taste or of large views<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159"
class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.’ There lay the difficulty: the great
viceroy loved to dictate, and hated to hear his opinions criticized.
Lord Liverpool, in announcing the rupture to Wellington in a letter
of a rather apologetic cast, explains the situation in a very few
words: ‘Lord Wellesley says generally that he has not the weight in
the Government which he expected, when he accepted office.... The
Government, though a cabinet, is necessarily <i>inter pares</i>, in which
every member must expect to have his opinions and his dispatches
canvassed, and this previous friendly canvass of opinions and measures
appears necessary, under a constitution where all public acts of
ministers will be hostilely debated in parliament.’ The Marquess
resented all criticism whatever.</p>

<p>The ministers assured Wellington that his brother’s resignation
would make no difference in their relations with himself, and invited
him to write as freely to Lord Castlereagh, who succeeded Wellesley
at the Foreign Office, as to his predecessor. The assurance of the
Cabinet’s good will and continued confidence was received—as it had
been given—in all sincerity. Not the least change in Wellington’s
relations with the Ministry can be detected from his dispatches. Nor
can it be said that the support which he received from home varied in
the least, after his brother’s secession from the Cabinet. Even the
grudging Napier is forced to concede this much, though he endeavours
to deprive the Perceval ministry of any credit, by asserting that
their only chance of continuance in office depended on the continued
prosperity of Wellington. Granting this, we must<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span> still conclude that Wellesley’s
resignation, even if it produced no disastrous results—as it well
might have done—was yet an unhappy exhibition of pride and petulance.
A patriotic statesman should have subordinated his own <i>amour propre</i>
to the welfare of Great Britain, which demanded that a strong
administration, pledged to the continuance of war with Napoleon, should
direct the helm of the State. He did his best to wreck Perceval’s
cabinet, and to put the Whigs in power.</p>

<p>The crisis in the Ministry passed off with less friction and less
results than most London observers had expected, and Lord Liverpool
turned out to be right when he asserted that in his opinion<a
id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
it would be of no material prejudice to the Perceval government.
Castlereagh, despite of his halting speech and his involved phrases,
was a tower of strength at the Foreign Office, and certainly replaced
Wellesley with no disadvantage to the general policy of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Here the jealousies and bickerings in London may be left for a
space. We shall only need to turn back for a moment to ministerial
matters when, at midsummer, the whole situation had been transformed,
for France and Russia were at last openly engaged in war, a great
relief to British statesmen, although at the same time a new trouble
was arising in the West to distract their attention. For the same month
that started Napoleon on his way to Moscow saw President Madison’s
declaration of war on Great Britain, and raised problems, both on
the high seas and on the frontiers of Canada, that would have seemed
heart-breaking and insoluble if the strength of France had not been
engaged elsewhere. But the ‘stab in the back,’ as angry British
politicians called it, was delivered too late to be effective.</p>

  <p class="subh2">WELLINGTON’S FIRST CAMPAIGN OF&nbsp;1812</p>
  <h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE CAPTURE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It is</span> with no small relief that we turn
away from the annals of the petty warfare in the provinces and of the
bickerings of politicians, to follow the doings of Wellington. All
the ‘alarms and excursions’ that we have been narrating were of small
import, compared with the operations on the frontiers of Portugal
and Leon which began at the New Year of 1812. Here we have arrived
at the true backbone of the war, the central fact which governed all
the rest. Here we follow the working out of a definite plan conceived
by a master-mind, and are no longer dealing with spasmodic movements
dictated by the necessities of the moment. For the initiative had at
last fallen into Wellington’s hands, and the schemes of Soult and
Marmont were no longer to determine his movements. On the contrary, it
was he who was to dictate theirs.</p>

<p>The governing factor in the situation in the end of December
1811 was, as we have already shown, the fact that Marmont’s army
had been so distracted by the Alicante expedition, undertaken by
Napoleon’s special orders, that it was no longer in a position to
concentrate, in full force and within a reasonably short period of
time. It was on December 13th<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161"
class="fnanchor">[161]</a> that the Duke of Ragusa received the
definitive orders, written on November 20-1, that bade him to send
towards Valencia, for Suchet’s benefit, such a force as, when joined by
a detachment from the Army of the Centre, should make up 12,000 men,
and to find 3,000 or 4,000 more to cover the line of communications
of the expedition. Accordingly orders were issued to Montbrun to
take up the enterprise, with the divisions of Foy and Sarrut,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span> and his own cavalry;
the concentration of the corps began on December 15th, and on
December 29th it marched eastward from La Mancha<a id="FNanchor_162"
href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> on its fruitless
raid.</p>

<p>Wellington’s policy at this moment depended on the exact
distribution of the hostile armies in front of him. He lay with the
bulk of his army wintering in cantonments along the frontier of
Portugal and Leon, but with the Light Division pushed close up to
Ciudad Rodrigo, and ready to invest it, the moment that the news
should arrive that the French had so moved their forces as to make it
possible for him to close in upon that fortress, without the danger
of a very large army appearing to relieve it within a few days. On
December 28th he summed up his scheme in a report to Lord Liverpool,
in which he stated that, after the El Bodon-Aldea da Ponte fighting in
September, he had ‘determined to persevere in the same system till the
enemy should make some alteration in the disposition of his forces<a
id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.’
In the meanwhile he judged that he was keeping Marmont and Dorsenne
‘contained,’ and preventing them from undertaking operations elsewhere,
unless they were prepared to risk the chance of losing Rodrigo. ‘It
would not answer to remove the army to the frontiers of Estremadura
(where a chance of effecting some important object might have offered),
as in that case General Abadia [and the Spanish Army of Galicia] would
have been left to himself, and would have fallen an easy sacrifice
to the Army of the North<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164"
class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.’ Therefore Wellington refused to take
the opportunity of descending upon Badajoz and driving Drouet out
of Estremadura, though these operations were perfectly possible. He
confined himself to ordering Hill to carry out the two raids in this
direction, of which the first led to the destruction of Girard at
Arroyo dos Molinos in October, and the second to the occupation of
Merida and the expulsion of the French from central Estremadura at
midwinter [December 27, 1811-January 13, 1812].</p>

<p>In October Wellington had hoped for some time that Rodrigo would
be gravely incommoded for lack of provisions, for it was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> almost cut off from the
army to which it belonged by the guerrillero bands of Julian Sanchez,
who dominated all the country between the Agueda and Salamanca, while
the Light Division lay on the heights close above it, ready to pounce
on any convoy that might try to pass in. This expectation, however,
had been disappointed, as a large amount of food had been thrown
into the place on November 2nd by General Thiébault, the governor of
Salamanca. This revictualling had only been accomplished by a mixture
of good management and good luck. The governor saw that any convoy
must have a large escort, because of the guerrilleros, who would have
cut off a small one. But a large escort could not move very fast, or
escape notice. Wherefore, taking no mean risk, Thiébault collected
3,400 men for a guard, stopped all exit of Spaniards from Salamanca
two days before the convoy started, gave out a false destination for
his movement, and sent out requisitions for rations for 12,000 men in
the villages between the starting-place and Rodrigo. Wellington had
been on the look-out for some such attempt, and had intended that the
Light Division, from its lair at Martiago in the mountain-valleys above
the city, should descend upon any force of moderate size that might
approach. But receiving, rather late, the false news that at least
three whole divisions were to serve as escort, he forbade Craufurd
to risk anything till he should have received reinforcements. The
same day the Agueda became unfordable owing to sudden rains, and no
troops could be sent across to join Craufurd. Wherefore Thiébault
got by, ere the smallness of his force was realized, and retreated
with such haste, after throwing in the food, that the Light Division
could not come up with him<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165"
class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. Such luck could not be expected another
time!</p>

<p>Wellington had begun to hurry up the nearest divisions to support
Craufurd, and had supposed for two days that he would have serious
fighting, since he imagined that 15,000 or 18,000 men at least had been
brought up to guard the convoy. It was a grave disappointment to him
to find that he had been misled, for it was clear that Rodrigo would
not be straitened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
for food for many a day. He had now to fall back on his original scheme
of reducing the place by a regular siege, when the propitious instant
should come round.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, waiting for the moment when Marmont and Dorsenne
should disperse their troops into a less concentrated position, he
took preliminary measures to face that eventuality when it should
occur. The main thing was to get the battering-train, with which
Ciudad Rodrigo would have to be attacked, close up to its objective.
As we have already seen<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, it had been collected far to the rear,
at the obscure village of Villa da Ponte near Trancoso. Between that
spot and Rodrigo there were eighty miles of bad mountain roads: if
Wellington had waited till he heard that Marmont had moved, before
he began to bring up his heavy guns, he would have lost many days.
Accordingly he commenced to push them forward as early as November
12th: their temporary shelter was to be in the fortress of Almeida,
which was already so far restored that it could be regarded as safe
against anything short of a regular siege. It was certain that Marmont
would not come forward at midwinter for any such operation, and against
raids or demonstrations the place was already secure. On December
4th Wellington reported<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> to Lord Liverpool that it would be
completely ‘re-established as a military post’ within a few weeks;
and on the 19th he announced that it was now ‘a place of security,’
and could be trusted to resist any attack whatever. But, long before
even the first of these dates, it was beginning to receive the
siege-material which Alexander Dickson was ordered to bring up from
the rear. As early as November 22nd the first division of heavy guns
entered its gates: it was given out—to deceive French spies—that the
pieces were only intended to arm the walls, and at the same time
Dickson was actively employed in mounting on them a number of guns of
heavy calibre, wrecked in the explosion when Brennier evacuated Almeida
in May 1811. Twenty-five of them were in position before Christmas Day.
The indefatigable artillery commandant had also hunted out of the ruins
no less than 8,000 round shot:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p.
161]</span> it was originally intended that they should go into
the magazines of the garrison; but, when the time for action came,
Wellington sent the greater part of this stock of second-hand shot to
the front, because they were immediately available, and ordered the
Almeida stores to be replenished, as occasion served, by the later
convoys that arrived from Villa da Ponte.</p>

<p>Nor was it in bringing forward guns and ammunition alone that
Wellington was busy during December: he caused a great quantity of
gabions and fascines to be constructed by the men of the four divisions
nearest the front, giving two vintems (2½<i>d.</i>) for every fascine
and four for every gabion. He had a very strong trestle-bridge cast
across the Agueda at Marialva, seven miles north of Rodrigo and out of
the reach of its garrison, and he began to collect carts from every
direction. Not only were they requisitioned in Beira, but Carlos de
España, who was lying in a somewhat venturesome position within the
frontiers of Leon, ordered the Spanish peasantry, even as far as
Tamames, to send every available ox-wain west-ward—and many came,
though their owners were risking dire chastisement at the hands of the
governor of the province of Salamanca.</p>

<p>Marmont, as we have seen, began to move troops eastward for
Montbrun’s Valencian expedition about December 15th. The first news of
this displacement reached Wellington on the 24th, when he heard that
Brennier’s division had evacuated Plasencia and fallen back behind
the Tietar, taking with it all its baggage, sick, and stores. This
might be no more than a change of cantonments for a single division,
or it might be a part of a general strategical move. Wellington wrote
to Hill that evening, ‘some say they are going to Valencia, some that
they are to cross the Tagus. I will let you know if I should learn
anything positive. I have not yet heard whether the movement has been
general, or is confined to this particular division<a id="FNanchor_168"
href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.’ The right deduction
was not drawn with certainty, because at the same time false
intelligence was brought that Foy had started from Toledo and gone
into La Mancha, but had returned again. This was a confused account
of his movement; but the rumour of his coming<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> back discounted the certain news about
Brennier’s eastward move<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"
class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>On the 29th came the very important additional information that
on the 26th Clausel’s Division, hitherto lying on the Upper Tormes,
above Salamanca, had marched upon Avila, and that the division already
at Avila was moving on some unknown eastward destination. At the
same time Wellington received the perfectly correct information that
all the cavalry of the Imperial Guard in Old Castile had already
started for Bayonne, and that the two infantry divisions of the Young
Guard, which formed the most effective part of Dorsenne’s Army of
the North, were under orders to march northward from Valladolid, and
had already begun to move.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> This was certain—less so a report sent in
by Castaños to the effect that he had learnt that the whole Army of
Portugal was about to concentrate at Toledo. On this Wellington writes
to Graham that ‘he imagines it is only a report from Alcaldes’—a
class of correspondents on whose accuracy and perspicacity he was not
accustomed to rely over-much<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171"
class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p>But enough information had come to hand to make it clear that a
general eastward movement of the French was taking place, and that
the troops immediately available for the succour of Ciudad Rodrigo
were both decreased in numbers and removed farther from the sphere
of Wellington’s future operations. He thought that the opportunity
given justified him in striking at once, and had drawn at last the
correct deduction: ‘I conclude that all these movements have for
their object to support Suchet’s operations in Valencia, or even
to co-operate with him<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.’ If Marmont were extending his troops so
far east as the Valencian border, and if Dorsenne were withdrawing
divisions northward from Valladolid, it was clear that they could not
concentrate in any short space of time for the deliverance of Rodrigo.
It was possible that the siege might linger on long enough to enable
the Armies of Portugal and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p.
163]</span> North to unite; Wellington calculated that it might
take as much as twenty-four or even thirty days—an estimate which
happily turned out to be exaggerated: in the end he stormed it only
twelve days after investment. But even if Rodrigo should resist its
besiegers sufficiently long to permit of a general concentration of
the enemy, that concentration would disarrange all their schemes, and
weaken their hold on many outlying parts of the Peninsula. ‘If I do
not succeed,’ wrote Wellington, ‘I shall at least bring back some of
the troops of the Army of the North, and the Army of Portugal, and
shall so far relieve the Guerrillas [Mina, Longa, Porlier] and the
Spanish Army in Valencia<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.’ The last-named force was, as a matter
of fact, beyond saving, when Wellington wrote his letter to Lord
Liverpool. But he could not know it, and if Blake had behaved with
common prudence and foresight in the end of December, his game ought
not to have been played out to a disastrous end early in January, just
when the British were moving out to the leaguer of Rodrigo.</p>

<p>All the divisions cantoned upon or behind the Beira frontier
received, on January 2nd-3rd, the orders which bade them prepare to
push up to the line of the Agueda. Only the 6th Division, which lay
farthest off, as far back as Mangualde and Penaverde near the Upper
Mondego, was not brought up to the front within the next few days. The
1st Division had a long march from Guarda, Celorico, and Penamacor,
the 4th and 5th Divisions very short ones from Aldea del Obispo and
Alameda, Villa de Ciervo, and other villages near Almeida. The 3rd
Division from Aldea da Ponte and Navas Frias had a journey greater than
those of the two last-named units, but much less than that of the 1st
Division. Finally the Light Division was, it may be said, already in
position: its outlying pickets at Pastores and Zamorra were already
within six miles of Rodrigo, and its head-quarters at Martiago only a
short distance farther back.</p>

<p>By January 5th the divisions were all at the front, though their
march had been carried out in very inclement weather—heavy snow fell
on the night of the 1st-2nd of the month, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> continued to fall on the third; while on
the 4th the wind shifted, the snow turned to sleet, and the roads grew
soft and slushy. The carts with stores and ammunition, pushing forward
from Almeida, only reached Gallegos—ten miles away—in two days. The
troops were well forward—the 1st Division at Espeja and Gallegos, the
3rd at Martiago and Zamorra, the 4th at San Felices, beyond the Agueda,
the Light Division at Pastores, La Encina and El Bodon. But Wellington
nevertheless had to put off the investment for three days, because
the train was not to the front. On the 6th he crossed the Agueda with
his staff and made a close reconnaissance of the place, unmolested by
the garrison. But it was only on the 8th that the divisions, who were
suffering severely from exposure to the wintry weather, received orders
to close in and complete the investment.</p>

<p>Of the topography of Ciudad Rodrigo we have already spoken at
some length, when dealing with its siege by Ney in 1810. The French
occupation had made no essential change to its character. The only
additions to its works made during the last eighteen months were the
erection of a small fort on the summit of the Greater Teson, and the
reinforcing by masonry of the three large convents in the suburb of San
Francisco, which the Spaniards had already used as places of strength.
The first-named work was a redoubt (named Redout Renaud, from the
governor whom Julian Sanchez had kidnapped in October): it mounted
three guns, had a ditch and palisades, and was built for a garrison of
seventy men. Its gorge contained a sally-port opening towards the town,
and was closed with palisades only. Four guns on the stone roof of the
fortified convent of San Francisco, and many more in the northern front
of the <i>enceinte</i>, bore upon it, and were intended to make access to it
dangerous and costly.</p>

<p>The breaches made during Ney’s siege, in the walls facing the
Tesons, had been well built up: but the new masonry, clearly
distinguishable by its fresh colour from the older stone, had not set
over well, and proved less hard when battered.</p>

<p>The garrison, supplied by the Army of the North, was not so numerous
as it should have been, particularly when it was intended to hold not
only the <i>enceinte</i> of the small circular town<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span> but the straggling suburb outside. It
consisted of a battalion each of the 34th Léger and the 113th Line,
from the division of Thiébault (that long commanded in 1810-11 by
Serras), making about 1,600 men, with two companies of Artillery and a
small detachment of sappers—the whole at the commencement of the siege
did not amount to quite 2,000 of all ranks, even including the sick in
the hospital. The governor was General Barrié, an officer who had been
thrust into the post much contrary to his will, because he was the only
general of brigade available at Salamanca when his predecessor Renaud
was taken by Julian Sanchez<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"
class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. The strength of the garrison had been
deliberately kept low by Dorsenne, because of the immense difficulty of
supplying it with provisions. The first convoy for its support had only
been introduced by bringing up 60,000 men, at the time of the fighting
about El Bodon in September: the second only by Thiébault’s risky
expedient on November 2nd.</p>

<p>The one thing that was abundant in the garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo
on January 8th, 1812, was artillery. Inside the place was lying the
whole siege-train of the Army of Portugal, which Masséna had stored
there when he started on his march into Portugal in September 1811. No
less than 153 heavy guns, with the corresponding stores and ammunition,
were parked there. A small fortress was never so stocked with munitions
of war, and the besieged made a lavish and unsparing use of them
during the defence: but though the shot and shell were available in
unlimited quantities, the gunners were not—a fortunate thing for the
besiegers.</p>

<p>The details of the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo are interesting. This
was the only one of Wellington’s sieges in which everything went
without a serious hitch from first to last—so much so that he took the
place in twelve days, when he had not dared to make his calculation
for less than twenty-four<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. Even the thing which seemed at first his
greatest hindrance—the extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p.
166]</span> inclemency of the weather—turned out in the end profitable.
The sleet had stopped on the 6th, and a time of light frosts set in,
without any rain or snow. This kept the ground hard, but was not bitter
enough to freeze it for even half an inch below the surface; the earth
was not difficult to excavate, and it piled together well. A persistent
north-east wind kept the trenches fairly dry, though it chilled the
men who were not engaged in actual spade work to the very bones. The
worst memory recorded in the diaries of many of the officers present
in the siege is the constant necessity for fording the Agueda in this
cold time, when its banks were fringed each morning with thin ice. For
the camps of all the divisions, except the 3rd, which lay at Serradilla
del Arroyo, some miles south-east of the city, were on the left bank
of the river, and the only bridge was so far off to the north that it
was little used, the short cut across the ford to the south of the town
saving hours of time: ‘and as we were obliged to cross the river with
water up to our middles, every man carried a pair of iced breeches
into the trenches with him<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176"
class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.’ There being very few villages in the
immediate neighbourhood of Rodrigo, many of the brigades had to bivouac
on the open ground—life being only made tolerable by the keeping up
of immense fires, round which the men spent their time when off duty,
and slept at night. But for the troops in the trenches there could
be no such comfort: they shivered in their great coats and blankets,
and envied those of their comrades who did the digging, which at any
rate kept the blood circulating. It is said that several Portuguese
sentries were found dead at their posts from cold and exhaustion each
morning.</p>

<p>Wellington’s general plan was to follow the same line which Ney
had adopted in 1810, i. e. to seize the Greater Teson hill, establish
a first parallel there, and then sap down to the lower Little Teson,
on which the front parallel and the breaching batteries were to be
established, at a distance of no more than 200 yards from the northern
<i>enceinte</i> of the city. But he had to commence with an operation which
Ney was spared—there was now on the crest of the Greater Teson the
new Redout Renaud, which had to be got rid of before the preliminary
preparation could be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>This little work
was dealt with in the most drastic and summary way. On the same evening
on which the army crossed the Agueda and invested the fortress, the
Light Division was ordered to take the redoubt by escalade, without
any preliminary battering. In the dark it was calculated that the
converging fires from the convent of San Francisco and the northern
walls would be of little importance, since the French could hardly
shell the work at random during an assault, for fear of hitting their
own men; and the attacking column would be covered by the night till
the very moment when it reached its goal.</p>

<p>Colonel Colborne led the storming-party, which consisted of 450
men, two companies from each British battalion, and one each from
the 1st and 3rd Caçadores<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177"
class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. His arrangements have received
well-deserved praise from every narrator of the enterprise. The
column was conducted to within fifty yards of the redoubt without
being discovered; then the two rifle companies and two of the 52nd
doubled out to the crest of the glacis, encircled the work on all
sides, and, throwing themselves on the ground, began a deliberate
and accurate fire upon the heads of the garrison, as they ran to
the rampart, roused at last by the near approach of the stormers.
So close and deadly was the fire of this ring of trained marksmen,
that after a few minutes the French shrank from the embrasures, and
crouched behind their parapets, contenting themselves with throwing
a quantity of grenades and live shells at haphazard into the ditch.
Their three cannon were only fired once! Such casual and ineffective
opposition could not stop the veterans of the Light Division. For three
companies of the 43rd and 52nd, forming the escalading detachment,
came rushing up to the work, got into the ditch by descending the
ladders which were provided for them, and then reared them a second
time against the fraises of the rampart, up which they scrambled
without much difficulty, finding the scarp not too steep and without
a <i>revêtement</i>. The garrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p.
168]</span> flinched at once—most of them ran into their guard-house
or crouched under the guns, and surrendered tamely. At the same time
entrance was forced at another point, the gorge, where a company,
guided by Gurwood of the 52nd, got in at the gate, which was either
unlocked by some of the French trying to escape, or accidentally
blown open by a live shell dropped against it<a id="FNanchor_178"
href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. Of the garrison two
captains and forty-eight rank and file were unwounded prisoners, three
were killed, and about a dozen more wounded. No more than four, it
is said, succeeded in getting back into the town<a id="FNanchor_179"
href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. This sudden
exploit only cost the stormers six men killed, and three officers<a
id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
and sixteen men wounded. Colborne remarks in his report that all the
losses were during the advance or in the ditch, not a man was hurt in
the actual escalade, for the enemy took cover and gave way, instead of
trying to meet the stormers with the bayonet.</p>

<p>The moment that the redoubt was stormed, the French gunners in the
city and the convent of San Francisco opened a furious fire upon it,
hoping to make it untenable. But this did little harm, for Colborne
withdrew the stormers at once—and the important spot that night was no
longer the work but the ground behind it, which was left unsearched.
For here, by Wellington’s orders, a first parallel 600 yards long was
opened, and approaches to it along the top of the Teson were planned
out. So little was the digging hindered, that by dawn the trenches were
everywhere three feet deep and four broad, sites for three batteries
had been marked out, and a communication had been run from the parallel
up to the redoubt, whose rear wall was broken down into the ditch, so
as to make it easily accessible.</p>

<p>It had been calculated that if the assault had failed, the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span> redoubt could only
have been reduced by regular battering for five days—that amount of
time, therefore, was saved by the escalade. The operation contrasts
singularly with the fruitless assaults on Fort San Cristobal at Badajoz
during the summer months of the preceding year, to which it bore a
considerable similarity. The difference of results may be attributed
mainly to the superiority of the arrangements made by Colborne, more
especially to the great care that he took to keep down the fire of the
besieged by a very large body of marksmen pushed close up to the walls,
and to the way in which he had instructed each officer in charge of a
unit as to the exact task that was imposed on him. At San Cristobal
there had been much courage displayed, but little management or
intelligence in the command.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 9th, the first parallel, along the front
of the Great Teson, was not so far advanced as to afford good cover,
and the working parties were kept back till dark, and employed in
perfecting the approaches from the rear: only fifty men were slipped
forward into the dismantled Redout Renaud, to improve the lodgement
there. The garrison fired fiercely all day on the parallel, but as
there was little to shoot at, very small damage was done. At noon the
1st Division relieved the Light Division at the front: for the rest of
the siege the arrangement was that each division took twenty-four hours
at the front in turn, and then returned to its camp. The order of work
was:</p>

<p>Light Division 8th-9th January, 12th-13th, 16th-17th, and for the
storm on the 19th.</p>

<p>1st Division 9th-10th, 13th-14th, 17th-18th.</p>

<p>4th Division 10th-11th, 14th-15th, 18th-19th.</p>

<p>3rd Division 11th-12th, 15th-16th, and for the storm on the 19th.</p>

<p>The 1st Division had very responsible work on the second night of
the siege, for when darkness had set in the first parallel had to be
made tenable, and the three batteries in front of it developed. Owing
to the very powerful artillery of the besieged, it was settled that the
batteries were to be made of exceptional strength and thickness—with
a parapet of no less than 18 feet breadth at the top. To procure the
necessary earth it was determined that an exterior ditch should be dug
in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span> them,
and that their floor (<i>terre-plain</i>) should be sunk 3 feet below the
level of the hillside within. A row of large gabions was placed in
front of the exterior ditch to give cover to the men digging it.</p>

<p>Great progress was made with the work under cover of the night, but
when morning came the besieged, whose fire had been at haphazard during
the night, could see the works and commenced to shoot more accurately.
A curious <i>contretemps</i> was discovered at dawn. By some miscalculation
the locality of the left-hand battery had been laid out a little too
far to the east, so that half its front was blocked by the ruins of
the Redout Renaud. This, of course, was the effect of working in pitch
darkness, when the outline of that work was invisible even from a score
or so of yards away. Possibly the error may have originated from the
fact that, early in the night, the directing engineer officer, Captain
Ross, was killed by a flanking shot from the convent of San Francisco.
Thus the men constructing the battery had been deprived of all superior
direction. In the morning Colonel Fletcher directed that the east
end of the battery should have no guns; the five which should have
been placed there were to be transferred to the right-hand battery,
which thus became designed for sixteen guns instead of eleven<a
id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.</p>

<p>On the 10th-11th January, when the 4th Division had charge of
the trenches the first parallel was nearly completed, the batteries
continued to be built up, magazine emplacements were constructed in
them, and a trench of communication between them was laid out. When
daylight revealed to the French the exact situation of the three
batteries, which were now showing quite clearly, a very fierce fire
was opened on them, the rest of the works being neglected. The losses,
which had hitherto been insignificant, began to grow heavy, and so many
men were hit in the exterior trenches, which were being dug in front of
each battery, that Wellington and Colonel Fletcher gave orders<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> that they should be
discontinued. Heavy damage was done to the batteries themselves—the
French adopted a system of firing simultaneous flights of shells with
long fuses at given points, ‘of which several falling together upon the
parapets blew away in an instant the work of whole hours.’</p>

<p>On the 11th-12th, with the 3rd Division in charge, the work was
continued; the platforms were placed in the batteries, and the
splinter-proof timbers laid over the magazine emplacements. But half
the exertion of the men had to be expended in repairs: as each section
of the batteries was completed, part of it was ruined by the besiegers’
shells. ‘The nights were long and bitter cold, and the men could not
decently be kept working for twelve hours on end<a id="FNanchor_182"
href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>,’ especially when it
was considered that they had to march four or five miles from their
camps to the trenches before commencing their task of digging, so
that they did not arrive fresh on the ground. Reliefs were therefore
arranged to exchange duty at one hour after midnight, so that no man
was at work for more than half of the cold hours of darkness.</p>

<p>On the 12th-13th, with the Light Division doing its second turn
at the front, the batteries were nearly completed, despite of much
heart-breaking toil at repairs. Wellington, before starting the task
of battering, put the problem to Colonel Fletcher as to whether it
would be possible to breach the walls with the batteries in the
first parallel, or whether these would only be useful for subduing
the fire of the besieged, and the actual breaching would have to be
accomplished by another set of batteries, to be placed in a second
parallel which was, as yet, contemplated but not begun. Fletcher,
after some cogitation, replied that he thought it could be done,
though Ney, in the siege of 1810, had failed in such a project, and
had breached the walls with batteries in situations much farther
forward. Wellington’s inquiry was dictated by his doubt as to whether
Marmont and Dorsenne might not be in a position to appear with a heavy
relieving force, before a second parallel could be thrown up. There
were, as yet, no signs of such a danger; the enemy having apparently
been taken completely unawares by the opening of the siege. But if the
second parallel advanced no faster in proportion than the first, and
had to be built on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span>
much more dangerous ground, it was clear that there was a risk of
its taking an inordinate time to complete. On Fletcher’s conclusion
being made, Wellington decided that he would try to breach the walls
with his original batteries, but would push forward a second parallel
also: if Marmont and Dorsenne showed signs of rapid concentration, he
would try to storm the place before the trenches were pressed forward
to the neighbourhood of the walls. If they did not, he would proceed
in more regular style, build a second and perhaps a third parallel,
with batteries close to the <i>enceinte</i>, and end by blowing in the
counterscarp, and assaulting from close quarters.</p>

<p>This resolution having been formed, Wellington ordered the second
parallel to be commenced on the night of the 13th-14th, with the 1st
Division in charge. Despite of a heavy fire from the French, who
discovered (by throwing fire-balls) that men were at work in front
of the first parallel, an approach by flying sap was pushed out,
from the extreme right end of the original trenches, down the slope
which separates the Great from the Lesser Teson, and a short length
of excavation was made on the western end of the latter height,
enough to allow of a small guard finding cover. This move brought the
besiegers very close to the fortified convent of Santa Cruz, outside
the north-western walls of the city, and lest it should give trouble
during the succeeding operations Wellington ordered it to be stormed.
The troops employed were 300 volunteers from the Line brigade of the
German Legion and one company of the 5/60th. They broke down the
palisades of the convent with axes, under a heavy fire, and as they
entered the small garrison fled with some loss. That of the stormers
was 6 killed and 1 officer and 33 men wounded<a id="FNanchor_183"
href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. Only by clearing the
French out of this post could the zig-zags leading down from the first
to the second parallel be completed without paying a heavy price in
lives, for the musketry of the convent would have enfiladed them in
several places. The same night the siege-guns, which had reached the
camp on the 11th, were moved into the three batteries.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span></p> <p>Next day (January
14-15) was a very lively one. General Barrié was convinced that the
establishment of a second parallel on the Lesser Teson, only 200 yards
from his walls, must not be allowed at any cost, and executed a sortie
with 500 men, all that he could spare from the garrison. He (very
cleverly) chose for his time the hour (11 a.m.) when the 4th Division
was relieving the workmen of the First, for, as Jones remarks, ‘a bad
custom prevailed that as soon as the division to be relieved saw the
relieving division advancing, the guards and workmen were withdrawn
from the trenches, and the works were left untenanted for some time
during the relief, which the French could observe from the steeple of
the cathedral, where there was always an officer on the look-out.’</p>

<p>The sortie recaptured the convent of Santa Cruz, swept along the
second parallel, where it upset the gabions and shovelled in some of
the earth, and then made a dash at the first parallel, where it might
have done much mischief in the batteries if General Graham and the
engineer officer on duty had not collected a few belated workmen of the
24th and 42nd, who made a stand behind the parapet, and opened a fire
which checked the advance till the relieving division came running up
from the rear. The French then turned and retired with little loss into
the place.</p>

<p>The advanced parallel and Santa Cruz were not reoccupied while
daylight lasted, but at about 4.30 in the afternoon the three batteries
opened with the 27 guns, which had been placed in them. Two 18-pounders
in the left battery were directed against the convent of San Francisco,
the rest against the northern part of the city, on the same point where
Ney’s breach had been made in 1810. Of the gunners, 430 in number,
nearly 300 were Portuguese<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184"
class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. The fire opened so late in the day that by
the time that it was growing steady and accurate dusk fell, and it was
impossible to judge what its future effect would be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when the big guns were silent, the work of preparing for
the nearer approach was resumed after dark. The most important move
on the night of the 14th-15th was the storming of the convent of San
Francisco by three companies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p.
174]</span> of the 40th regiment. The garrison made little resistance,
and retired, abandoning three guns and two wounded men. Immediately
afterwards the posts in the neighbouring suburb were all withdrawn by
Barrié, who considered that he could not afford to lose men from his
small force in the defence of outlying works, when his full strength
was needed for the holding of the town itself. Santa Cruz, on the other
side, though recovered in the morning, was abandoned on this same night
for identical reasons. The French general was probably wise, but it
was a great profit to the besiegers to be relieved from the flanking
fire of both these convents, which would have enfiladed the two ends of
the second parallel. That work itself was reoccupied under the cover
of the night: the gabions upset during the sortie of the morning were
replaced, and much digging was done behind them. The zig-zags of the
approach from the upper trenches on the Great Teson were deepened and
improved. All this was accomplished under a heavy fire from the guns
on the northern walls, which were so close to the second parallel that
their shells, even in the dark, did considerable damage.</p>

<p>When day dawned on the 15th, the breaching batteries on the Great
Teson opened again with excellent effect. Their fire was concentrated
on the rebuilt wall of the <i>enceinte</i>, where the French breach of 1810
had been mended. It was necessary to batter both the town wall proper
and the <i>fausse-braye</i> below it, so as to make, as it were, an upper
and a lower breach, corresponding to each other, in the two stages of
the <i>enceinte</i>. It will be remembered that, as was explained in our
narrative of the French siege<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185"
class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, the mediaeval ramparts of the old wall
showed well above the eighteenth-century <i>fausse-braye</i> which ran
around and below them, while the latter was equally visible above the
glacis, which, owing to the downward slope from the Little Teson, gave
much less protection than was desirable to the work behind it. The
French breach had been carefully built up; but, lime being scarce in
the neighbourhood, the mortar used in its repairs had been of inferior
quality, little better than clay in many places. The stones, therefore,
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> never set into
a solid mass, even eighteen months after they had been laid, and began
to fly freely under the continuous battering.</p>

<p>The breaching being so successful from the first, Wellington
resolved to hurry on his operations, though there were still no
signs that Marmont or Dorsenne was about to attempt any relief of
the garrison. Yet it was certain that they must be on the move, and
every day saved would render the prospect of their interference less
imminent. Accordingly it was settled that the second parallel should
be completed, and that, if possible, more batteries should be placed
in it, but that it was to be looked upon rather as the base from which
an assault should be delivered than as the ground from which the main
part of the breaching work was to be done. That was to be accomplished
from the original parallel on the Great Teson, and one more battery
was marked out on this hill, close to the Redout Renaud, but a little
lower down the slope, and slightly in advance of the three original
batteries. From this new structure, whose erection would have been
impossible so long as San Francisco was still held by the French,
Wellington proposed to batter a second weak point in the <i>enceinte</i>,
a mediaeval tower three hundred yards to the right of the original
breach. All the attention of the French being concentrated on the work
in the second parallel, this new battery (No. 4) was easily completed
and armed in three days, and was ready to open on its objective on
January 18th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the completion of the second parallel proved a difficult
and rather costly business. By Wellington’s special orders all the
energies of the British batteries were devoted to breaching, and no
attempt was made to subdue the fire of those parts of the <i>enceinte</i>
which bore upon the trenches, but were far from the points selected
for assault. Hence the French, undisturbed by any return, were able
to shoot fast and furiously at the advanced works, and searched the
second parallel from end to end. It was completed on the 18th, and two
guns were brought down into a battery built on the highest point of the
Little Teson, only 180 yards from the walls. An attempt to sap forward
from the western end of the second parallel, so as to get a lodgement
a little nearer to the place, was completely<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> foiled by the incessant fire of grape
kept up on the sap-head. After many workmen had been killed, the
endeavour to push forward at this point was abandoned, such an advance
forming no essential part of Wellington’s scheme. The enemy’s fire on
the second parallel was made somewhat less effective on the 16th-18th
by digging rifle-pits in front of the parallel, from which picked
marksmen kept up a carefully aimed fusillade on the embrasures of the
guns to left and right of the breach. Many artillerymen were shot
through the head while serving their pieces, and the discharges became
less incessant and much less accurate. But the fire of the besieged
was never subdued, and the riflemen in the pits suffered very heavy
casualties.</p>

<p>The 18th may be described as the crucial day of the siege. The new
battery (No. 4) on the Greater Teson opened that morning against the
tower which had been chosen as its objective. By noon it was in a very
ruinous condition, and at dusk all its upper part fell forward ‘like
an avalanche,’ as the governor says in his report, and covered all
the platform of the <i>fausse-braye</i> below. Barrié remarks that this
point was admirably chosen by Wellington’s engineers, ‘it was unique
in the <i>enceinte</i> for the facilities which it offered for breaching
and the difficulties for defence. This is the spot where the walls are
lowest, the parapet thinnest, and the platforms both of the ramparts
and the <i>fausse-braye</i> narrowest. Moreover here had been situated the
gun which best flanked the original great breach<a id="FNanchor_186"
href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.’</p>

<p>The garrison found it impossible either to repair the breaches or
to clear away the débris which had fallen from them. All that could
be done was to commence retrenchments and inner defences behind them.
This was done with some effect at the great breach, where cuts were
made in the ramparts on each side of the demolished section, parapets
thrown up behind the cuts, and two 24-pounders dragged into position
to fire laterally into the lip of the easy slope of débris which
trended up to the ruined wall. At the second or smaller breach much
less was accomplished—the warning was short, for it had never been
guessed that this tower was to be battered, and the space upon which
work could be done was very limited. It was hoped that the narrowness
of the gap might be its protection—it was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span> but a seam in the wall compared with the
gaping void at the first and greater breach.</p>

<p class="mt1">On the morning of the 19th the fire was recommenced,
with some little assistance from the two guns which had now begun to
work from the advanced battery in the second parallel. The breaches
continued to crumble: that at the tower looked as easy in slope (though
not nearly so broad) as that at the original point of attack, and an
incessant fire all day kept the enemy from making any repairs. No more
could be done for the breaches, wherefore Wellington ordered that some
of the siege-guns should turn their attention to silencing the French
fire from the remoter points of the northern wall. Several of their
guns were dismounted: but even by dusk there were many still making
reply.</p>

<p>There was now nothing to prevent the assault from being delivered,
since it had been settled that no attempt was to be made to sap up
nearer the walls, or to blow in the counterscarp. Wellington wrote his
elaborate directions for the storm sitting under cover in a trench of
one of the advanced approaches, to which he had descended in order
to get the closest possible view of the fortress<a id="FNanchor_187"
href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p>The orders were as follows. The chosen time was seven o’clock, an
hour sufficiently dark to allow the troops to get forward without being
seen as they filled the trenches, yet soon enough after nightfall to
prevent the French from doing any appreciable repairs to the breaches
under cover of the dark.</p>

<p>The main assaults were to be delivered by the 3rd Division on
the great breach, and by the Light Division on the lesser breach.
There were also to be two false attacks delivered by small bodies of
Portuguese troops, with the purpose of distracting the attention of
the besieged to points remote from the main assault: either of them
might be turned into serious attempts at escalade if the circumstances
favoured.</p>

<p>The two brigades of the 3rd Division were given two separate ways of
approaching the main breach. Campbell’s brigade [2/5th, 77th, 2/83rd,
94th], after detaching the 2/83rd to line the second parallel, and
to keep up a continual fire on the walls, was to assemble behind the
ruined convent of Santa Cruz.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p.
178]</span> Debouching from thence, the 2/5th, turning to the right,
were to make for the place where the counterscarp (covering the whole
north front) joined with the body of the place, under the castle
and not far from the river. They were to hew down the gate by which
the ditch was entered, jump down into it, and from thence scale the
<i>fausse-braye</i> by ladders, of which a dozen, 25 feet long, were issued
to them. It was probable that there would be few French found here, as
the point was 500 yards west of the main breach. After establishing
themselves upon the <i>fausse-braye</i>, they were to scour it eastward,
clearing off any parties of the enemy that might be found upon it,
and to push for the breach, where they would meet the main assaulting
column. The 94th were to make a similar dash at the ditch, half-way
between the point allotted to the 5th and the breach, but not to mount
the <i>fausse-braye</i>: they were to move to their left along the bottom of
the ditch, clearing away any palisades or other obstacles that might be
found in it, and finally to join the main column. The 77th was to form
the brigade-reserve, and support where necessary.</p>

<p>Mackinnon’s brigade was to undertake the frontal storm of the great
breach. Its three battalions (1/45th, 74th, 1/88th) were to be preceded
by a detachment of 180 sappers carrying hay-bags, which were to be
thrown into the ditch to make the leap down more easy. The head of the
column was to be formed by 300 volunteers from all the battalions, then
came the main body in their usual brigade order, the 1/45th leading.
Power’s Portuguese (9th and 21st Line) formed the divisional reserve,
and were to be brought down to the second parallel when Mackinnon’s
column had ascended the breach.</p>

<p>A support on the left flank of the breach was to be provided by
three companies of the 95th, detached from the Light Division, who,
starting from beside the convent of San Francisco, were to carry out
the same functions that were assigned to the 94th on the other side,
viz. to descend into the ditch half-way between the two breaches, and
proceed along its bottom, removing any obstacles found, till they
joined Mackinnon’s brigade at the foot of the wall.</p>

<p>Craufurd, with the rest of the Light Division, which was to
move from the left of San Francisco, was to make the attack<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span> on the lesser breach. The
storming-column was to be formed of Vandeleur’s brigade (1/52nd and
2/52nd, four companies of the 1/95th, and the 3rd Caçadores). Barnard’s
brigade was to form the reserve, and to close in towards the place when
the leading brigade should reach the ditch. The division was to detach
marksmen (four companies of the 95th) who were to keep up a fire upon
the enemy on the walls, just as the 2/83rd did for the 3rd Division.
A provision of hay-bags carried by caçadores was made, in the same
fashion as at the great breach.</p>

<p>The two subsidiary false attacks were to be made—one by Pack’s
Portuguese (1st and 16th regiments) on the outworks of the gate of
Santiago on the south-east side of the town, the other by O’Toole’s
Portuguese battalion (2nd Caçadores), headed by the light company of
the 2/83rd, on the outwork below the castle, close to the bank of the
Agueda. This column would have to rush the bridge, which the French had
left unbroken, because it was completely commanded by the castle and
other works immediately above it. Both the Portuguese columns carried
ladders, and were authorized to attempt an escalade, if they met little
or no resistance at points so remote from the breaches, as was quite
possible.</p>

<p>Both the Light and 3rd Divisions were fresh troops that night,
as the 4th Division had been in charge of the trenches on the 19th.
The stormers marched straight up from their distant camps to the
starting-points assigned to them in the afternoon. The news that the
Light Division had moved to the front out of its turn was the clearest
indication to the whole army that the assault was fixed for that
night.</p>

<p>A few minutes before seven o’clock the storm began, by the sudden
rush of the 2/5th, under Major Ridge, from behind the convent of Santa
Cruz, across the open ground towards the ditch on their left of the
castle. The governor had expected no attack from this side, the troops
on the walls were few, and it was only under a very scattering fire
that the battalion hewed down the gate in the palisades, got down into
the ditch, and then planted their ladders against the <i>fausse-braye</i>.
They were established upon it within five minutes of their start,
and then, turning to their left, drove along its platform, chasing
before them a few small parties of the enemy. In this way they<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> soon arrived at the heap
of ruins representing the spot where <i>fausse-braye</i> and inner wall had
been wellnigh battered into one common mass of débris. Here they found
the 94th, who had entered the ditch at the same time as themselves, but
a little to their left, and had met with equally feeble resistance,
already beginning to mount the lower slopes of the breach. Thus by a
curious chance these two subsidiary columns arrived at the crucial
point a little before the forlorn hope of the main storming-column.
Mackinnon’s brigade, starting from the parallels, had to climb over the
parapets of the trenches, and to cross rougher ground than the 5th and
94th: they were also hindered by the tremendous fire opened upon them:
all the attention of the French had been concentrated on them from the
first, as their route and their destination were obvious. Hence, unlike
Campbell’s battalions, they suffered heavily before they crossed the
glacis, and they were delayed a little by waiting for the hay-bags
which were to help their descent. When the storming-party, under Major
Manners of the 74th, reached the breach, it was already covered by men
of the 5th and 94th. The whole, mixed together, scrambled up the higher
part of the débris under a deadly fire, and reached the lip of the
breach, where they found before them a sixteen-foot drop into the level
of the city, on to ground covered with entanglements, beams, <i>chevaux
de frise</i>, and other obstacles accumulated there by the prescience of
the governor. On each flank, for the whole breadth of the wall, was a
cutting, surmounted by a parapet, on which was mounted a 24-pounder
firing grape downwards on to them.</p>

<p>The head of the column had scarcely gained the lip of the breach
when it was raked by the simultaneous discharge of these two guns,
which absolutely exterminated the knot of men at its head. At the same
time an explosion took place lower down, from some powder-bags which
the enemy had left among the débris and fired by means of a train. The
impetus of the column was checked, and it was some little time before
more men fought their way up to the summit: a second discharge from the
two flanking guns made havoc of these, and shut in by the cuts, upon a
space of about 100 feet wide, with the impracticable descent into the
town in front, the assailants came to a stand again. The only way out
of the difficulty was to cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p.
181]</span> the cuts, and storm the parapets behind them. This was
done at both ends: on the one side a small party of the 88th, throwing
down their muskets, so as to have hands to climb with, scrambled over
the gap and slew with their bayonets the gunners at the left-hand gun,
before they could fire a third round: they were followed by many men of
the 5th, and a footing was gained on the ramparts behind the obstacle<a
id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.
On the right flank Major Wylde, the brigade-major of Mackinnon’s
brigade, found a few planks which the French had been using to
bridge the cut before the storm, and which they had thrown down but
neglected to remove. These were relaid in haste, and a mass of men
of the 45th rushed across them under a dreadful fire, and forced the
right-hand retrenchment. The garrison, giving way at both ends, fired
a mine prepared under a postern of the upper wall as they retired<a
id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.
This produced an explosion much more deadly than the one at the
commencement of the storm; it slew among others General Mackinnon, the
senior brigadier of the 3rd Division, whose body was found thrown some
distance away and much blackened with powder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, even before the fighting at the great breach was over,
the fate of Ciudad Rodrigo had been settled at another point. The
storm of the lesser breach by the Light Division had been successful,
after a shorter fight and with much less loss of blood. Vandeleur’s
brigade here conducted the assault, headed by 300 volunteers from the
three British regiments of the division under Major George Napier of
the 52nd: Lieutenant Gurwood of the same regiment had the forlorn hope
of 25 men. The column did not come under fire for some time after
leaving cover, but the assault had been expected, and a keen watch
was being kept. Nevertheless the ditch was reached without any great
loss, and the stormers leaped in, unaided for the most part by the
hay-bags which 150 of Elder’s caçadores were to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> have cast down for them, for the greater
part of the Portuguese were late in arriving<a id="FNanchor_190"
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. They then began to
plant their ladders, but the forlorn hope went wrong in an odd way,
for moving too far to the left along the <i>fausse-braye</i> they scrambled
up and over a traverse<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"
class="fnanchor">[191]</a> which had been built across it, so finding
themselves still on the same level. The head of the main storming party
was better directed, and poured up the breach, which was very narrow
but clean and clear: the only obstacle at its head was a disabled gun
placed horizontally across the gap. Another piece, still in working
order, had a diagonal view of the whole slope. The first discharge
of this gun, crammed with grape, shattered the head of the column:
Major Napier was dashed down with a mangled arm, Colonel Colborne, who
was leading the 52nd, got a ball in the shoulder, and several other
officers fell. At about the same moment General Craufurd, who was
standing on the glacis above the ditch, directing the movements of
the supports, received a bullet which passed through his arm, broke
two ribs, and finally lodged in his spine. By his mortal hurt and the
almost simultaneous wounding of his senior brigadier, Vandeleur, the
command of the Light Division passed to Andrew Barnard of the 95th, who
was leading the rear brigade.</p>

<p>But the division had been started on its way up the breach, and the
gun on its flank got no second opportunity to fire. After its first
discharge the survivors at the head of the column, now led by Uniacke
and W. Johnston both of the 95th, dashed furiously up the remaining
few feet of débris and reached the summit. The voltigeurs facing them
broke before the onset, and since there were here no traverses or cuts
to prevent the extension of the troops to right or left as they reached
their goal, many hundreds were soon in possession of the ramparts<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span> on each side of the
breach. The men of the 52nd wheeled to the left and swept the ramparts
as far as the Salamanca gate, which they found walled up: the 43rd and
Rifles turned to the right, and came upon the French retreating from
the great breach, where the 3rd Division were just bursting through.
Some of them arrived just in time to suffer from the final explosion
which killed Mackinnon and so many of his brigade<a id="FNanchor_192"
href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

<p>With their line forced in two places simultaneously, the garrison
could do no more: there was a little fighting in the streets, but not
much. The majority of the garrison retired to the Plaza Mayor in front
of the castle, and there laid down their arms in mass. At the same
time the two Portuguese subsidiary attacks had succeeded. O’Toole’s
caçadores, headed by the light company of the 2/83rd, had not only
captured by escalade the outwork against which they were directed, but
found and hewed down its sally-port by which they got entrance into
the town. Pack’s brigade, on the other side of the place, stormed the
redan in front of the Santiago gate, and lodged themselves therein,
capturing its small garrison. The governor and his staff had taken
refuge in the castle, a mediaeval building with a lofty square tower
commanding the Agueda bridge. They had hardly any men with them,
and wisely surrendered at the first summons<a id="FNanchor_193"
href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.</p>

<p>Seven thousand excited and victorious soldiers, with all traces
of regimental organization lost, were now scattered through the
streets of Ciudad Rodrigo. This was the first time on which the
Peninsular Army had taken a place by assault,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> and the consequent confusion does not
seem to have been foreseen by any one. But while the officers and the
steady men were busy in collecting the French prisoners, throwing open
the gates, and seeing to the transport of the wounded into houses, the
baser spirits—and in every battalion, as Sir John Colborne remarks<a
id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>,
there were in those days from fifty to a hundred incorrigibles—turned
to plunder. The first rush was to the central brandy-store of the
garrison, where hundreds got drunk in a few minutes, and several
killed themselves by gorging raw spirits wholesale. But while the mere
drunkards proceeded to swill, and then turned out into the streets
firing objectlessly in the air, the calculating rascals set themselves
to the plunder of private houses, which was a more profitable task
than rummaging the French magazines. There was an immense amount of
unlicensed pillage and wanton destruction of property—inexcusable in a
place where only a small minority of the people were <i>Afrancesados</i>,
and the majority had been getting ready to welcome their deliverers.
The officers did their best to restore order, ‘the voice of Sir Thomas
Picton was heard with the strength of twenty trumpets proclaiming
damnation to all and sundry, while Colonels Barnard and Cameron with
other active officers, seized the broken barrels of muskets, which
were lying about in great abundance, and belaboured misdemeanants
most unmercifully<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195"
class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.’ But active officers could not be
everywhere—three houses, including the spirit store in the great
square, were set on fire by drunken plunderers, and it was feared that
a conflagration might arise, which fortunately did not happen, for the
solid stone structures were not easily kindled. The disorder, however,
did not reach the shameful pitch which was afterwards seen at Badajoz
and St. Sebastian. A competent observer, present at all three sacks,
remarks that ‘no town taken by assault suffered less than Rodrigo. It
is true that soldiers of all regiments got drunk, pillaged, and made
great noise and confusion in streets and houses, despite of every
exertion of their officers to prevent it. But bad and revolting as such
scenes are, I never heard that either the French garrison, after its
surrender, or the inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p.
185]</span> suffered personal indignities or cruelty from the troops<a
id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.’
There were apparently no lives lost, except those of a few men shot
accidentally by their drunken comrades, and of certain drunkards who
perished in the spirit store. The greater part of the men were under
control long before dawn, and were collected by their officers on
the ramparts: they marched out next morning, when the 5th Division,
newly arrived at the front from its distant cantonments in Beira,
came into the town. By an unfortunate accident an explosion of an
unsuspected magazine took place, just as the French prisoners were
being marched out, and some of them and of their escort were killed<a
id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. The
storming regiments made a strange spectacle as they left the town.
‘As we marched over the bridge dressed in all varieties imaginable,
some with jack-boots on, others with white French trousers, others in
frock-coats with epaulettes, some even with monkeys on their shoulders,
we met the 5th Division on their way to repair the breaches. They
immediately formed upon the left of the road, presented arms, and
cheered us. I was afterwards told that Lord Wellington, who saw us
pass, inquired of his staff, “Who the devil are <i>those</i> fellows<a
id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>?”’</p>

<p>The garrison, out of a little under 2,000 men present when the
siege began, showed 60 officers and 1,300 rank and file of unwounded
prisoners. Eight officers had been killed, 21 wounded, and about 500
rank and file, mostly on the day of the assault. The artillery and
engineers suffered most—of 8 artillery officers in the place 5 were
killed or wounded, of three engineer officers two fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span>The British
and Portuguese loss during the whole siege was 9 officers killed and
70 wounded, and of other ranks 186 were killed and 846 wounded, with
10 missing—apparently deserters. Of these, 59 officers and 503 rank
and file fell in the actual storm. The tables appended at the end
of this volume demonstrate that the 3rd Division suffered far more
heavily than the Light—the battalions with the greatest losses were
the 2/5th and 94th, which were early on the great breach and got the
benefit of the explosion. Of the 9 officers killed or mortally hurt
two were generals, Craufurd and Mackinnon. The death of the former,
who lingered in great agony for four days, though shot through to the
spine, was no small event in the war: his talents were sadly missed
in its latter years: an outpost officer of his capacity would have
been invaluable to Wellington during the fighting in the Pyrenees in
1813, when the Light Division, though regimentally as good as ever,
much lacked the skilful leading of its old chief. He was a man with
many friends and many enemies: of his merits and defects I spoke at
length in another place<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199"
class="fnanchor">[199]</a>. Here I feel compelled to quote nothing more
than the words of his friend, Lord Londonderry—the Charles Stewart of
the Peninsular War. ‘He was an officer of whom the highest expectation
had been formed, and who on every occasion found an opportunity to
prove that, had his life been spared, the proudest hopes of his country
would not have been disappointed, and he was a man to know whom in
his profession without admiring him was impossible. To me his death
occasioned that void which the removal of a sincere friend alone
produces. While the memory of the brave and the skilful shall continue
to be cherished by British soldiers, he will not be forgotten, and
the hand which scrawls this humble tribute to his worth must be cold
as his own, before the mind which dictates it shall cease to think of
him with affection and regret<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200"
class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.’</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER II">SECTION XXXII: CHAPTER II</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALL OF&nbsp;CIUDAD&nbsp;RODRIGO</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> extraordinary speed with which
Wellington had in twelve days reduced Ciudad Rodrigo, a fortress that
had held out for twenty-four days of open trenches when besieged by
Ney in 1810, surprised the captor himself, who had reckoned on taking
no shorter time in its leaguer than had the French. But it absolutely
appalled his two adversaries, Marmont and Dorsenne, whose whole scheme
of operations had rested on the idea that they could count on some
three weeks or more for preparation, when the news that the place was
invested got to their hands.</p>

<p>Thiébault, the governor of Salamanca, had been warning both the
commander of the Army of the North and the commander of the Army of
Portugal for some weeks that Wellington might move at any moment<a
id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.
But his reports to the effect that the British were making gabions
and fascines, preparing a bridge over the Agueda, and bringing up
siege-guns to Almeida, made little or no impression on his superiors,
because they had come to the conclusion that it was unlikely that
Wellington would undertake a siege at midwinter. His preparations, they
thought, were probably intended to force his enemies to concentrate, at
a time when roads were bad and food unprocurable: ‘ils n’ont d’autre
but que de nous faire faire de faux mouvements,’ said one of Marmont’s
aides-de-camp. It was only in the spring that the allied army would
become really enterprising and dangerous.</p>

<p>Astonishing as it may appear, though Wellington’s troops started
on January 2nd, and though Rodrigo was invested and the Redout
Renaud stormed on January 8th, the definitive<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> news that the siege had actually begun
only reached Salamanca on January 13th. No better proof could be given
of the precarious nature of the French hold on the kingdom of Leon.
The fact was that the guerrilleros of Julian Sanchez so obsessed
all the roads from Salamanca to Rodrigo, that no messenger could
pass without a very large escort. Barrié only got the news that he
was attacked to Thiébault by entrusting it to a Spanish emissary,
who carried his note in disguise, and by a long détour. Marmont and
Dorsenne only received it on the 14th: King Joseph at Madrid only on
the 25th. On the 13th Marmont was in such a state of blindness as to
the actual situation that he was writing to Berthier that ‘si l’armée
anglaise passait l’Agueda j’attendrais sur la Tormès la division du
Tage et les troupes que le Général Dorsenne pourrait m’amener, <i>mais
sans doute ce cas n’arrivera pas</i>. Ciudad Rodrigo sera approvisionné
jusqu’à la récolte, et à moins d’un siège il ne doit pas être l’objet
d’aucune sollicitude<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"
class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.’ Wellington, when this was written, had
already passed troops over the Agueda some ten days back, and had been
beleaguering Ciudad Rodrigo for five. Yet Marmont was dating from
Valladolid, which was not much over 100 miles from the hard-pressed
fortress. Truly, thanks to the guerrilleros, the ‘fog of war’ was lying
heavily round the Marshal.</p>

<p>Owing to a circumstance of which Wellington could have no knowledge,
the moment which he chose for his advance was even more propitious than
he guessed. He knew of the march of Montbrun towards Valencia, and had
made it the determining factor in his operations. But he was not, and
could not be, aware of another fact of high importance. On December
29th Marmont, then at Talavera, had received a dispatch from Paris,
dated on the 13th of the same month, informing him that the Emperor
had resolved on making a sweeping change with regard to the respective
duties and stations of the Armies of the North and of Portugal.
Hitherto Dorsenne had been in charge of the whole kingdom of Leon:
the troops stationed in it belonged to his army, and on him depended
the garrisons of Ciudad Rodrigo, Astorga, and its other fortresses.
He was, therefore, responsible for the keeping back of Wellington
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span> all the ground
north of the Sierra de Gata. Marmont, with his Army of Portugal, had
to ‘contain’ the Anglo-Portuguese army south of that range, and had
charge of the valley of the Tagus—northern Estremadura and those parts
of New Castile which had been taken away from King Joseph’s direct
control. From this central position the Duke of Ragusa had hitherto
been supposed to be able to stretch out a hand to Dorsenne, in case of
Wellington’s making a move in the valley of the Douro, to Soult in case
of his showing himself opposite Badajoz. This indeed Marmont had done:
he had brought up his army to Dorsenne’s aid in September, at the time
of El Bodon and Aldea da Ponte: he had carried it down to the Guadiana
and assisted Soult to relieve Badajoz in June.</p>

<p>Berthier’s dispatch<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203"
class="fnanchor">[203]</a>, received on December 29th—it had taken
sixteen days to reach its destination—informed Marmont that the Emperor
had resolved to place the task of ‘containing’ Wellington, when he
should operate north of the Tagus, in the hands of one instead of
two commanders-in-chief. ‘Considering the importance of placing the
command on the whole frontier of Portugal under a single general,
His Majesty has decided that the provinces of Avila, Salamanca,
Plasencia, Ciudad Rodrigo, the kingdom of Leon, Palencia, and the
Asturias, shall belong to the Army of Portugal.’ Along with them were
to be handed over to Marmont Souham’s division, then lying in the
direction of Zamora, Benavente, and La Baneza, and Bonnet’s division,
then in the Asturias—whose central parts (as it will be remembered<a
id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>)
that general had reconquered in November 1811. The district of the
Army of the North was for the future to be limited to the eastern
parts of Old Castile, Santander, Biscay, and Navarre. The real cause
of this change, though Berthier’s dispatch lays no stress upon it, was
the order recently sent to Dorsenne, which bade him return to France
the two strong divisions of the Imperial Guard, which had hitherto
formed the most important and effective section of the Army of the
North. They were wanted for the probable Russian war, and without them
Napoleon rightly judged that Dorsenne would be too weak to ‘contain’
Wellington, hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>
down all Leon, and observe the Galicians, in addition to hunting Mina
and curbing the incursions of Longa and Porlier. Wherefore he resolved
to confine the activity of the Army of the North to the lands east and
north of Burgos, where its main task would be the crushing of Mina and
his compatriots. Marmont should take upon his shoulders the entire
responsibility for holding back the Anglo-Portuguese.</p>

<p>But, by the Emperor’s orders, the Army of Portugal, though now
charged with a much heavier task than before, was not to get any
appreciable increase in numbers. It is true that Marmont was to take
over the divisions of Souham and Bonnet, along with the regions that
they were occupying. These were strong units, and would have increased
his total strength by 16,000 men. But at the same time he was told
that Thiébault’s division<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"
class="fnanchor">[205]</a>, the other force in the kingdom of Leon,
was not to be given him, but to be withdrawn eastward and to remain
under Dorsenne. With it were to go other details belonging to the
Army of the North, employed in garrison duty in the valley of the
Douro, such as the Swiss battalions long garrisoning the city of Leon,
Benavente, and Valladolid<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206"
class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. Now it was clear that if these garrisons
were withdrawn, Marmont would have to find other troops from his own
divisions to replace them. Moreover, he was in addition instructed that
Bonnet’s division, though now to be regarded as under his command, was
not on any excuse to be moved out of the Asturias. ‘It is indispensable
that he should remain there, because in that position he menaces
Galicia, and keeps down the people of the mountains. You would have to
use more troops to guard all the edge of the plain from Leon to St.
Sebastian than are required for the Asturias. It is demonstrable in
theory, and clearly proved by experience, that of all operations the
most important is the occupation of the Asturias, which makes the right
of the army rest upon the sea, and continually threatens Galicia.’</p>

<p>If, therefore, Marmont was forbidden to use Bonnet, and had
to replace all the existing garrisons of Leon (including that of
Ciudad Rodrigo, as he was specially informed) by troops drawn from
his own force, he was given a vast increase of territory to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span> watch, but no appreciable
increase of numbers to hold it—no more in fact than the difference
between the strength of Souham’s division (placed on the side of gain)
and that of the new garrisons (placed on the side of loss). The net
profit would be no more than 3,000 or 4,000 men at the most.</p>

<p>In addition the Marshal was restricted further as to the way in
which he was to dispose of his army. He was told to leave one division
(or, if he chose, two) in the valley of the Tagus, about Plasencia and
Almaraz, for the purpose of keeping up his communication with Madrid
and Andalusia. The rest of his army was to be moved across the Sierra
de Gata into the valley of the Douro, and its head-quarters were to
be placed at Valladolid, or if possible at Salamanca. Therefore,
if Wellington advanced, only four and a half, or five and a half,
divisions out of the eight now comprising the Army of Portugal, could
be concentrated against him with promptitude: Bonnet and the troops
left in the Tagus valley would be long in arriving. So would the
nearest divisions of the Army of the North, of which the most westerly
would be as far off as Burgos, the rest still farther towards the
Pyrenees. Till he had received some of these outlying succours, Marmont
would be too weak to resist Wellington. Five divisions (say 30,000 men)
could not keep the Anglo-Portuguese contained—though eight might very
possibly suffice.</p>

<p>But on December 29, 1811, Marmont had not eight divisions at his
disposition. The Emperor’s misguided order for the Valencian expedition
was in progress of being executed, and it was precisely on that same
day that Montbrun with two divisions of foot and one of horse was
marching off eastward from La Mancha, in an excentric direction, which
took him to the shore of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Marmont’s available force, after this march began, was as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Souham’s division at La Baneza, Benavente, and Zamora, watching
Abadia’s Army of Galicia. This unit had yet to be informed that it had
become part of the Army of Portugal.</p>

<p>(2-3) Brennier’s and Maucune’s divisions at Almaraz and Talavera in
the valley of the Tagus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span>(4) Clausel’s
division at Avila.</p>

<p>(5)&nbsp;Ferey’s division in La Mancha, keeping up communication
with Montbrun’s expeditionary column.</p>

</div>

<p>The other three divisions of the Army of Portugal, as now
constituted, those of Bonnet in the Asturias, and of Foy and Sarrut in
march for Valencia, were hopelessly out of reach.</p>

<p>Being directed, in very clear and decisive terms, to transfer
himself in person to Valladolid or Salamanca, and to move the bulk of
his troops thither from the valley of the Tagus, the Marshal had to
obey. He directed Brennier’s division alone to remain behind at Almaraz
and Talavera. Maucune and Clausel, with Ferey presently to follow,
began a toilsome march across the mountains to Leon. They had to
abandon the magazines (such as they were) which had been collected for
their subsistence in winter-quarters, and to march across bad roads, in
the most inclement month of the year, through an unpeopled country, for
cantonments where no stores were ready for them.</p>

<p>While Marmont was marching up in the early days of January to occupy
his newly-designated positions, Dorsenne was employed in withdrawing
his troops eastward, away from the neighbourhood of Wellington, towards
the province of Burgos. He himself stopped behind at Valladolid,
to see Marmont and hand over in person the charge of the districts
which he was ordered to evacuate. His view of the situation at the
moment may be judged by an extract from a letter which he directed
to Marmont on January 5<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.</p>

<p>‘I have the honour to enclose herewith two letters dated on the
1st and 3rd instant from General Thiébault at Salamanca. I attach no
credence to their contents, for during the last six months I have been
receiving perpetually similar reports.... If, contrary to my opinion,
the English have really made some tentative movements on Ciudad
Rodrigo, and if Julian Sanchez has tried to cut our communication
with that place, I can only attribute it to your recent movement on
Valencia. In that case, the unforeseen reappearance of your Excellency
here may make the enemy change his plan of operations, and may prove
harmful to him.’</p>

<p>Thiébault had cried ‘Wolf!’ too often to please Dorsenne,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> and the latter had no
real apprehension that Wellington was already on the move. No more had
Marmont. On arriving at Valladolid on January 13th he wrote to Berthier
(five days after the trenches were opened at Rodrigo!), ‘It is probable
that the English may be on the move at the end of February, and then
I shall have need of all my troops: I have, therefore, told Montbrun
to start on his backward march towards me before the end of January<a
id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.’
By the end of January Rodrigo had already been for twelve days in the
hands of the British army.</p>

<p>And if Dorsenne and Marmont were blind to the actual situation, so,
most of all, was their master. The dispatch which gave over the charge
of the kingdom of Leon to Marmont contains the following paragraph:</p>

<p>‘If General Wellington (<i>sic</i>) after the rainy season is over
(i. e. after February) should determine to take the offensive,
you can then unite all your eight divisions for a battle: General
Dorsenne from Burgos would support you, by marching up from Burgos
to your assistance. But such a move is not to be expected (<i>n’est
pas présumable</i>). The English, having suffered heavy losses, and
experiencing great difficulties in recruiting their army, all
considerations tend to make us suppose that they will simply confine
themselves to the defence of Portugal.... Your various dispatches
seem to prove that it is at present no longer possible for us to take
the offensive against Portugal, Badajoz being barely provisioned, and
Salamanca having no magazines. It is necessary, therefore, to wait till
the crops of the present year are ripe [June!], and till the clouds
which now darken the political situation to the North have disappeared.
His Majesty has no doubt that you will profit by the delay, to organize
and administer the provinces under your control with justice and
integrity, and to form large magazines.... The conquest of Portugal and
the immortal glory of defeating the English are reserved for you. Use
therefore all possible means to get yourselves into good condition for
commencing this campaign, when circumstances permit that the order for
it should be given.... Suggestions have been made that Ciudad Rodrigo
should be dismantled. The Emperor considers that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> this would be a great mistake: the enemy,
establishing himself in that position, would be able to intercept the
communications between Salamanca and Plasencia, and that would be
deplorable. The English know quite well that if they press in upon
Rodrigo, or invest it, they expose themselves to be forced to deliver
a battle—that is the last thing they want: however, if they did so
expose themselves, it would be your duty to assemble your whole army
and march straight at them<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209"
class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.’</p>

<p>Such being Napoleon’s views at midwinter, it is strange to find
Napier asserting that the disasters of the French at this time were
caused partly by the jealousies of his lieutenants, partly by their
failing to understand his orders in their true spirit, so that they
neglected them, or executed them without vigour<a id="FNanchor_210"
href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. Without denying that
Marmont, Dorsenne, and Soult were jealous of each other, we may assert
that the real fundamental origin of all their disasters was that their
master persisted in directing the details of the war from Paris,
founding his orders on data three weeks old, and sending those orders
to arrive another fortnight or three weeks after they had been written.
As a fair example of what was perpetually happening we may cite the
following dates. Wellington started to move on January 1st, 1812, as
Thiébault wrote to Dorsenne (on the report of a Spanish spy) on January
3rd: on January 27 the general information that the Anglo-Portuguese
army had crossed the Agueda, without any details, reached the Emperor,
and caused him to dictate a dispatch for Dorsenne, giving him leave
to detain the two divisions of the Imperial Guard under orders for
France, and to support Marmont with them: the Emperor added that he
hoped that by January 18th Montbrun would be nearing Madrid, and that
by the end of the month his column would have joined the Army of
Portugal. Eight days <i>before</i> this dispatch was written Ciudad Rodrigo
was already in Wellington’s hands: the news of its fall on January
19th seems to have reached Paris on February 11th<a id="FNanchor_211"
href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>, whereupon, as we shall
presently see, the Emperor dictated another dispatch to Marmont, giving
elaborate instructions on the new condition<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> of affairs. This (travelling quicker than
most correspondence) reached Marmont at Valladolid on February 26<a
id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>:
but of what use to the Marshal on that day were orders dictated upon
the basis of the state of affairs in Leon on January 19th? ‘On ne
dirige pas la guerre à trois ou quatre cents lieues de distance,’ as
Thiébault very truly observed<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213"
class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.</p>

<p>It was precisely Napoleon’s determination to dictate such operations
as Montbrun’s Alicante expedition, or the transference of Marmont’s
head-quarters from the valley of the Tagus to Valladolid, without any
possible knowledge of the circumstances of his lieutenants at the
moment when his orders would come to hand, that was the fatal thing.
With wireless telegraphy in the modern style he might have received
prompt intelligence, and sent directions that suited the situation.
But under the conditions of Spain in 1812 such a system was pure
madness.</p>

<p>‘The Emperor chose,’ as Marmont very truly observes, ‘to cut down
the numbers of his troops in Spain [by withdrawing the Guards and
Poles] and to order a grand movement which dislocated them for a time,
precisely at the instant when he had increased the dispersion of
the Army of Portugal, by sending a detachment of 12,000 men against
Valencia. He was undoubtedly aware that the English army was cantoned
in a fairly concentrated position on the Agueda, the Coa, and the
Mondego. But he had made up his mind—I cannot make out why—that the
English were not in a condition to take the field: in every dispatch
he repeated this statement.’ In fairness to his master, Marmont should
have added that he was of the same opinion himself, that Dorsenne
shared it, and that both of them agreed to treat the Cassandra-like
prophecies which Thiébault kept sending from Salamanca as ‘wild and
whirling words.’</p>

<p>Marmont reached Valladolid, marching ahead of the divisions
of Clausel and Maucune, on the 11th or 12th of January. He found
Dorsenne waiting for him, and they proceeded to concert measures
for the exchange of territory and troops which the Emperor had
imposed upon them. After dinner on the evening<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span> of the 14th arrived Thiébault’s definite
and startling news that Wellington, with at least five divisions in
hand, had invested Rodrigo on the 8th, and was bringing up a heavy
battering-train. The siege had already been six days in progress.</p>

<p>This was very alarming intelligence. The only troops actually in
hand for the relief of Rodrigo were Thiébault’s small division at
Salamanca, Souham’s much larger division about La Baneza and Benavente,
and Clausel’s and Maucune’s divisions, now approaching Valladolid from
the side of Avila. The whole did not make much more than 20,000 men, a
force obviously insufficient to attack Wellington, if he were in such
strength as Thiébault reported. Dorsenne at once sent for Roguet’s
division of the Imperial Guard from Burgos: Marmont ordered Bonnet to
evacuate the Asturias and come down by the route of Leon to join him:
he also directed Brennier to come up from the Tagus, and Ferey to hurry
his march from La Mancha. Aides-de-camp were sent to hunt for Foy, who
was known to be on the borders of the Murcian regions, where Montbrun
had dropped him on his march to Alicante. Montbrun himself, with the
rest of his column, was also to turn back as soon as the orders should
reach him.</p>

<p>By this concentration Marmont calculated<a id="FNanchor_214"
href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> that he would have
32,000 men in line opposite Wellington by January 26 or 27th, as
Bonnet, Brennier, and Dorsenne’s Guards should have arrived by then.
And by February 1 Ferey and Foy ought also to be up, and more than
40,000 men would be collected. Vain dates! For Wellington captured
Rodrigo on the 19th, seven days before the Marshal and Dorsenne could
collect even 32,000 men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marmont pushed on for Salamanca, where the troops were
to concentrate, having with him only the divisions of Clausel and
Maucune. On January 21st he had reached Fuente Sauco, one march
north of Salamanca, when he received the appalling news that Ciudad
Rodrigo had been stormed by Wellington two days before. This was a
thunderstroke—his army was caught not half concentrated, and he was
for the moment helpless. He advanced as far as Salamanca, and there
picked up Thiébault’s division, but even so he had not more<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span> that 15,000 men in hand,
and dared not, with such a handful, march on Rodrigo, to endeavour to
recover it before Wellington should have restored its fortifications.
Bonnet had not yet even reached Leon: Ferey and Dorsenne’s Guard
division had not been heard of. As to where Foy and Montbrun might
be at the moment, it was hardly possible to hazard a guess. The only
troops that could be relied upon to appear within the next few days
were the divisions of Souham and Brennier. Even with their help the
army would not exceed 26,000 or 28,000 men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wellington, with seven divisions now in hand, for he
had brought up both the 5th and the 7th to the front, was lying on
the Agueda, covering the repairs of Ciudad Rodrigo. Marmont had at
first thought that, elated by his recent success, the British general
might push his advance towards Salamanca. He made no signs of doing
so: all his troops remained concentrated on the Portuguese frontier,
ready to protect the rebuilding of Rodrigo. Here, on the day after the
storm, all the trenches were filled in, and the débris on the breaches
removed. Twelve hundred men were then turned to the task of mending the
breaches, which were at first built up with fascines and earth only,
so as to make them ready within a few days to resist a <i>coup-de-main</i>.
In a very short time they were more or less in a state of defence, and
on February 15th Castaños produced a brigade of Spanish infantry to
form the new garrison of the place. The work was much retarded by the
weather. Throughout the time of the siege it had been bitterly cold
but very dry: but on the 28th the wind shifted to the west, and for
the nine days following there was incessant and torrential rain, which
was very detrimental to the work. It had, however, the compensating
advantage of preventing Marmont from making any advance from Salamanca.
Every river in Leon was over its banks, every ford impassable, the
roads became practically useless. When, therefore, on February 2nd<a
id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the
Agueda rose to such a height that Wellington’s trestle-bridge was
swept away, and the stone town-bridge of Rodrigo was two feet under
water, so that the divisions cantoned on the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span> Portuguese frontier were cut off from the
half-repaired fortress, there was no pressing danger from the French,
who were quite unable to move forward.</p>

<p>Marmont, as we have seen, had reached Fuente Sauco on January
21st, and Salamanca on January 22nd. On the following day Souham,
coming in from the direction of Zamora, appeared at Matilla, half
way between Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo, so that he was in touch
with his chief and ready to act as his advanced guard. But no other
troops had come up, and on the 24th the Marshal received a hasty
note from Dorsenne, saying that the division of the Young Guard from
Burgos would not reach the Tormes till February 2<a id="FNanchor_216"
href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. With only four
divisions at his disposition (Clausel, Maucune, Thiébault, Souham)
Marmont dared not yet move forward, since he knew that Wellington had
at least six in hand, and he shrank from committing himself to decisive
action with little more than 20,000 men assembled. On the 28th Dorsenne
sent in a still more disheartening dispatch than his last: he had now
ordered Roguet’s Guards, who had got as far forward as Medina del
Campo, to return to Burgos<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. The reasons given were that Mina had just
inflicted a severe blow on General Abbé, the commanding officer in
Navarre, by beating him near Pampeluna with a loss of 400 men, that
the Conde de Montijo, from Aragon, had laid siege to Soria, and was
pressing its garrison hard, and that another assembly of guerrillero
bands had attacked Aranda del Duero, and would take it, if it were not
succoured in a few days. ‘I therefore trust that your excellency will
approve of my having called back Roguet’s division, its artillery, and
Laferrière’s horse, to use them for a <i>guerre à outrance</i> against the
guerrillas.’ Nothing serious—he added—would follow, as all reports
agreed that Wellington was sitting tight near Ciudad Rodrigo, and would
make no advance toward Salamanca.</p>

<p>No succours whatever, therefore, were to be expected from the Army
of the North: Bonnet had only just recrossed the Cantabrian mountains,
much incommoded by the bad weather in the passes, and Foy and Montbrun
were only expected in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p.
199]</span> neighbourhood of Toledo early in February. Therefore
Marmont abandoned all hope of attacking Wellington before Ciudad
Rodrigo should be in a state of defence. The desperately rainy weather
of January 28th to February 6th was no doubt the last decisive fact
in making the Marshal give up the game. Before the rain had ceased
falling, he concluded that all chance of a successful offensive move
was gone, for he returned from Salamanca to Valladolid on February
5th.</p>

<p>On February 6th he wrote to Berthier<a id="FNanchor_218"
href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> that he had ordered
Montbrun and Foy, on their return from the Alicante expedition,
to remain behind in the valley of the Tagus, and not to come on
to Salamanca. His reason for abandoning all idea of a general
concentration against Wellington in the kingdom of Leon, was that he
was convinced that the next move of the British general would be to
make a dash at Badajoz, and that he wished to have a considerable force
ready in the direction of Almaraz and Talavera, with which he could
succour the Army of the South, when it should be compelled to march,
as in 1811, to relieve that fortress. His forecast of Wellington’s
probable scheme of operations was perfectly correct, and his idea
that the best way to foil it would be to hold a large portion of his
army in the valley of the Tagus was correct also. But he was not
to be permitted to carry out his own plan: the orders from Paris,
which he so much dreaded, once more intervened to prescribe for him
a very different policy<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219"
class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.</p>

<p>Wellington during the critical days from January 20th to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> February 6th was
naturally anxious. He knew that Marmont would concentrate against
him, but he hoped (as indeed he was justified in doing) that the
concentration would be slow and imperfect, and that the Marshal would
find himself too weak to advance from Salamanca. His anxiety was made
somewhat greater than it need have been, by a false report that Foy
and Montbrun were already returned from the Alicante expedition—he was
told that both had got back to Toledo by the beginning of January<a
id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>—a
most mischievous piece of false news. An equally groundless rumour
informed him that Bonnet had left the Asturias, many days before his
departure actually took place. On January 21 he wrote to Lord Liverpool
that Bonnet had passed Benavente on his way to Salamanca, and that ‘the
whole of what had gone eastward’ [i. e. Foy and Montbrun] was reported
to be coming up from the Tagus to Valladolid, so that in a few days
Marmont might possibly have 50,000 men in hand<a id="FNanchor_221"
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. To make himself strong
against such a concentration he ordered Hill, on January 22, to bring
up three brigades of the 2nd Division to Castello Branco, with which
he might join the main army at a few days’ notice<a id="FNanchor_222"
href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. At the same time he
directed General Abadia to send a force to occupy the Asturias, which
must be empty since Bonnet had evacuated it. It was not till some
days later that he got the reassuring, and correct, news that Foy and
Montbrun, instead of being already at the front in Castile, were not
even expected at Toledo till January 29th, and that Bonnet had started
late, and was only at La Baneza when February had already begun. But,
by the time that he had received this information, it had already
become evident that Marmont was not about to take the offensive, and
Ciudad Rodrigo was already in a condition to resist a <i>coup-de-main</i>;
while, since the whole siege-train of the Army of Portugal had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> been captured therein,
it was certain that the Marshal could not come up provided with the
artillery required for a regular siege.</p>

<p>By February 12th the real state of affairs became clear, ‘the enemy
has few troops left at Salamanca and in the towns on the Tormes, and
it appears that Marshal Marmont has cantoned the right of his army on
the Douro, at Zamora and Toro, the centre in the province of Avila,
while one division (the 6th) has returned to Talavera and the valley
of the Tagus.’ This was nearly correct: Marmont, on February 6th, had
defined his position as follows—two divisions (those just returned
from the Alicante expedition) in the valley of the Tagus; one, the
6th (Brennier), at Monbeltran, in one of the passes leading from the
Tagus to the Douro valley; one (Clausel) at Avila; three on the Douro
and the Esla (Zamora, Toro, Benavente) with a strong advanced guard at
Salamanca. The heavy detachment towards the Tagus, as he explained, was
to provide for the probable necessity of succouring Badajoz, to which
Wellington was certain to turn his attention ere long.</p>

<p>Marmont was perfectly right in his surmise. Ciudad Rodrigo had
hardly been in his hands for five days, when Wellington began to issue
orders presupposing an attack on Badajoz. On January 25th Alexander
Dickson was directed to send the 24-lb. shot and reserve powder
remaining at the artillery base at Villa da Ponte to be embarked on
the Douro for Oporto, where they were to be placed on ship-board<a
id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. Next
day it was ordered that sixteen howitzers of the siege-train should
start from Almeida overland for the Alemtejo, each drawn by eight
bullocks, while twenty 24-pounders were to be shipped down the Douro
from Barca de Alva to Oporto, and sent round from thence to Setubal,
the seaport nearest to Elvas<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224"
class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. On the 28th Dickson himself was ordered
to start at once for Setubal, in order that he might be ready to
receive each consignment on its arrival, and to make arrangements
for its transport to Elvas<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"
class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, while a dispatch was sent to Hill<a
id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
definitely stating that, if all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p.
202]</span> went well, the siege of Badajoz was to begin in the second
week of March.</p>

<p>These plans were drawn up long before it was clear that the army
might not have to fight Marmont on the Agueda, for the defence of
Ciudad Rodrigo. ‘If they should move this way, I hope to give a
good account of them,’ Wellington wrote to Douglas (the British
officer attached to the Army of Galicia)<a id="FNanchor_227"
href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>: but he judged it more
likely that no such advance would be made. ‘I think it probable that
when Marmont shall have heard of our success, he will not move at all<a
id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.’
Meanwhile there was no need to march the army southward for some time,
since the artillery and stores would take many weeks on their land
or water voyage, when roads were bad and the sea vexed with winter
storms. So long as seven divisions were cantoned behind the Agueda
and Coa, Marmont could have no certain knowledge that the attack on
Badajoz was contemplated, whatever he might suspect. Therefore no
transference southward of the divisions behind the Agueda was begun
till February 19th. But Wellington, with an eye on Marmont’s future
movements, contemplated a raid by Hill on the bridge of Almaraz, the
nearest and best passage which the French possessed on the Tagus. If
it could be broken by a flying column, any succours from the Army of
Portugal to the Army of the South would have to take a much longer
route and waste much time<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229"
class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. The project was abandoned, on Hill’s
report that he doubted of its practicability, since a successful
<i>coup-de-main</i> on one of the bridge-head forts might not secure the
actual destruction of the boats, which the French might withdraw
to the farther side of the river, and relay at their leisure<a
id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. But,
as we shall see, the scheme was postponed and not entirely rejected: in
May it was carried out with complete success.</p>

<p>While Wellington was awaiting the news that his siege artillery was
well forward on the way to Elvas, Marmont had been undergoing one of
his periodical lectures from Paris. A dispatch sent to him by Berthier
on January 23, and received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p.
203]</span> at Valladolid on February 6th—fourteen days only having
been occupied by its travels—had of course no reference to Wellington
or Ciudad Rodrigo, the news of the investment of that fortress having
only reached Paris on January 27th. It was mainly composed of censures
on Montbrun’s Alicante expedition, which Napoleon considered to have
been undertaken with too large a force—’he had ordered a flying column
to be sent against Valencia, a whole army corps had marched.’ But the
paragraph in it which filled Marmont with dismay was one ordering him
to make over at once 6,000 men to the Army of the North, whose numbers
the Emperor considered to be running too low, now that the two Guard
divisions had been directed to return to France.</p>

<p>‘Twenty-four hours after the receipt of this dispatch you will start
off on the march one of your divisions, with its divisional artillery,
and its exact composition as it stands at the moment of the arrival
of this order, and will send it to Burgos, to form part of the Army
of the North. His Majesty forbids you to change any general belonging
to this division, or to make any alterations in it. In return you
will receive three provisional regiments of detachments, about 5,000
men, whom you may draft into your battalions. They are to start from
Burgos the day that the division which you are ordered to send arrives
there. All the Guards are under orders for France, and can only start
when your division has reached that place.... The Army of the North
will then consist of three divisions: (1) that which you are sending
off; (2) Caffarelli’s division (due at Pampeluna from Aragon); (3)
a third division which General Dorsenne will organize from the 34th
Léger, the 113th and 130th of the line and the Swiss battalions....
By this arrangement the Army of the North will be in a position to
aid you with two divisions if the English should march against you<a
id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span></p> <p>Along
with this dispatch arrived another from Dorsenne<a id="FNanchor_232"
href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>, clamouring for the
division which was to be given him—he had already got the notice that
he was to receive it, as he lay nearer to France than Marmont. He
promised that the three provisional regiments should be sent off, as
the Emperor directed, the moment that the ceded division should reach
him. The Duke of Ragusa could not refuse to obey such peremptory orders
from his master, and ordered Bonnet’s division, from Benavente and
Leon, to march on Burgos. His letter acknowledging the receipt of the
Emperor’s dispatch was plaintive. ‘I am informed that, according to the
new arrangement, the Army of the North will be in a position to help
me with two divisions if I am attacked. I doubt whether His Majesty’s
intentions on this point will be carried out, and in no wise expect it.
I believe that I am justified in fearing that any troops sent me will
have to be long waited for, and will be an insignificant force when
they do appear. Not to speak of the slowness inevitable in all joint
operations, it takes so long in Spain to get dispatches through, and
to collect troops, that I doubt whether I shall obtain any help at the
critical moment.... The net result of all is that I am left much weaker
in numbers.’</p>

<p>Marmont might have added that the three provisional regiments,
which he was to receive in return for Bonnet’s division and the
130th Line, were no real reinforcement, but his own drafts, long due
to arrive at the front, but detained by Dorsenne in Biscay and Old
Castile to garrison small posts and keep open communications. And he
was not destined to receive them as had been promised: Dorsenne wrote
on February 24 apologizing for not forwarding them at once: they were
guarding the roads between Irun and Vittoria, and could not be spared
till other troops had been moved into their scattered garrisons to
relieve them.</p>

<p>On January 27th the news of the advance of Wellington against
Ciudad Rodrigo had at last reached Paris—eight days after the fortress
had fallen. It caused the issue of new orders by the Emperor, all
exquisitely inappropriate when they reached Marmont’s hands on February
10th. The Marshal had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p.
205]</span> contemplating the tiresome results of the storm of the
fortress for nearly three weeks, but Napoleon’s orders presupposed much
spare time before Rodrigo would be in any danger: Dorsenne is to stop
the march of the Guards towards France, and to bring up all the forces
he can to help the Army of Portugal: Montbrun will be back at Madrid
by January 18 [on which day he was really in the middle of the kingdom
of Murcia], and at the front in Leon before February 1st. After his
arrival the Army of Portugal will be able to take up its definitive
line of action. Finally, there is a stab at Marmont, ‘the English
apparently have advanced in order to make a diversion to hamper the
siege of Valencia; they only did so because they had got information
of the great strength of the detachment which the Army of Portugal
made in that direction<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233"
class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Marshal could only reply by saying that the orders were all out
of date, that he had (as directed) given up Bonnet’s division to the
Army of the North, and that, Ciudad Rodrigo having fallen far earlier
than any one had expected, and long before any sufficient relieving
force could be collected, he had been unable to save it, and had now
cantoned his army (minus Bonnet) with four divisions in the valley of
the Douro and three in the valley of the Tagus, in expectation of an
approaching move on the part of Wellington towards Badajoz.</p>

<p>These dispositions had not long been completed when another dispatch
arrived from Paris, dated February 11th, in which the Emperor censured
once more all his lieutenant’s actions, and laid down for him a new
strategical policy from which he was forbidden to swerve.</p>

<p>‘The Emperor regrets that when you had the division of Souham
and three others united [i.&nbsp;e. on January 23] you did not move on
Salamanca, to make out what was going on. That would have given the
English much to think about, and might have been useful to Ciudad
Rodrigo. The way to help the army under the present circumstances is
to place its head-quarters at Salamanca, and concentrate your force
there, detaching one division to the Tagus valley and also reoccupying
the Asturias. [This concentration] will oblige the enemy to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span> remain about Almeida and
in the North, for fear of an invasion of Portugal. You might even march
on Rodrigo, and, if you have the necessary siege artillery, capture
the place—your honour is bound up with it. If want of the artillery or
of food renders it necessary to put off such an operation, you could
at least make an incursion into Portugal, and advance towards the
Douro and Almeida. This menace would keep the enemy “contained”....
Your posture should be offensive, with Salamanca as base and Almeida
as objective: as long as the English know that you are in strength
at Salamanca they will not budge: but if you retire to Valladolid
yourself, and scatter divisions to the rear, and above all if you have
not got your cavalry effective by the time that the rainy season ends,
you will expose all the north of Spain to misfortunes.</p>

<p>‘It is indispensable to reoccupy the Asturias, because more troops
are needed to hold the edge of the plain as far as Biscay than to keep
down that province. Since the English are divided into two corps,
one in the South and the other opposite you, they cannot be in heavy
strength: you ought to outnumber them greatly.... I suppose that you
consider the English mad, for you believe them capable of marching
against Badajoz when you are at Salamanca, i. e. of allowing you to
march to Lisbon before they can get back. They will only go southward
if you, by your ill-devised schemes, keep two or three divisions
detached on the Tagus: that reassures them, and tells them that you
have no offensive projects against them.</p>

<p>‘To recapitulate, the Emperor’s intentions are that you should
stop at Salamanca, that you should reoccupy the Asturias, that your
army should base itself on Salamanca, and that from thence you should
threaten the English.’</p>

<p>It may seem profane to the worshippers of the Emperor to say
that this dispatch was purely wrong-headed, and argued a complete
misconception of the situation. But it is impossible to pass any
other verdict on it. Marmont, since Bonnet’s division had been stolen
from him, had seven divisions left, or about 44,000 men effective,
including cavalry and artillery. The Emperor tells him to keep one
division on the Tagus, to send a second to occupy the Asturias. This
leaves him about 34,000 net to concentrate at Salamanca. With this
force he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span> to
attempt to besiege Rodrigo, or at least to execute a raid as far as
Almeida and the Douro. ‘The English are divided and so must be much
numerically inferior to you.’ But, as a matter of fact, the only
British detachment that was not under Wellington’s hand at the moment
was Hill’s 2nd Division, and he had just brought that up to Castello
Branco, and would have had it with him in five days, if Marmont had
advanced from Salamanca. The Marshal would have seen 55,000 men
falling upon his 34,000 if he had moved on any day before the 20th
of February, and Wellington was ‘spoiling for a fight,’ or, in his
own quiet phraseology, ‘if the French move this way, I hope to give
a good account of them<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234"
class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.’ Supposing Marmont had, by some evil
inspiration, done what the Emperor had wished him to do before the
orders came, he would have been crushed by almost double numbers
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Rodrigo or Almeida. The battle of
Salamanca would have been fought six months too soon.</p>

<p>This is the crucial objection to Napoleon’s main thesis: he
underrated Wellington’s numbers and his readiness to give battle. As
to details we may observe (1) that there was no siege-train to batter
Rodrigo, because the whole of the heavy guns of the Army of Portugal
had been captured in that fortress. (2) That Wellington was ‘mad’
enough to march upon Badajoz with his whole army, precisely because
he knew that, even if Marmont should invade Portugal, he could never
get to Lisbon. He realized, as the Emperor did not, that an army
of five or six divisions could not march on Lisbon in the casual
fashion recommended in this dispatch, because it would starve by the
way. Central Portugal, still suffering from the blight of Masséna’s
invasion, could not have sustained 30,000 men marching in a mass and
trying to live upon the country in the usual French style. And Marmont,
as his adversary well knew, had neither great magazines at his base,
nor the immense transport train which would have permitted them to be
utilized. The best proof of the impracticability of Napoleon’s scheme
was that Marmont endeavoured to carry it out in April, when nothing
lay in front of him but Portuguese militia, and failed to penetrate
more than a few marches into the land, because he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span> could not feed his army, and therefore
could not keep it concentrated.</p>

<p>The Marshal knew long beforehand that this plan was hopeless. He
wrote to Berthier from Valladolid on February 26th as follows:</p>

<p>‘Your Highness informs me that if my army is united at Salamanca
the English would be “mad” to move into Estremadura, leaving me
behind them, and free to advance on Lisbon. But they tried this
precise combination in May 1811, though all my army was then quite
close to Salamanca, and though the Army of the North was then twice
as strong as it is to-day, and though the season was then later and
allowed us to find provender for our horses, and though we were then
in possession of Ciudad Rodrigo. They considered at that time that
we could not undertake such an operation [as a march on Lisbon], and
were perfectly right. Will they think that it is practicable to-day,
when all the conditions which I have just cited are changed to our
disadvantage, and when they know that a great body of troops has
returned to France?... Consequently no movement on this side can help
Badajoz. The only possible course is to take measures directly bearing
on that place, if we are to bring pressure upon the enemy and hope to
attain our end. The Emperor seems to ignore the food question. This
is the important problem; and if it could be ended by the formation
of base-magazines, his orders could be executed with punctuality and
precision. But we are far from such a position—by no fault of mine....
When transferred to the North in January, I found not a grain of wheat
in the magazines, not a sou in the treasury, unpaid debts everywhere.
As the necessary result of the absurd system of administration adopted
here, there was in existence a famine—real or artificial—whose severity
was difficult to realize. We could only get food for daily consumption
in our cantonments by using armed force: there is a long distance
between this state of affairs and the formation of magazines which
would allow us to move the army freely.... The English army is always
concentrated and can always be moved, because it has an adequate supply
of money and transport. Seven or eight thousand pack-mules bring up
its daily food—hay for its cavalry on the banks of the Coa and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> Agueda has actually
been sent out from England<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235"
class="fnanchor">[235]</a>. His Majesty may judge from this fact the
comparison between their means and ours—we have not four days’ food in
any of our magazines, we have no transport, we cannot draw requisitions
from the most wretched village without sending thither a foraging party
200 strong: to live from day to day we have to scatter detachments to
vast distances, and always to be on the move.... It is possible that
His Majesty may be dissatisfied with my arguments, but I am bound to
say that I cannot carry out the orders sent me without bringing about
a disaster ere long. If His Majesty thinks otherwise, I must request
to be superseded—a request not made for the first time: if I am given
a successor the command will of course be placed in better hands<a

    <big><i>Marshal Marmont, Duke of Ragusa</i></big>
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">This was an admirable summary of the whole situation
in Spain, and might have caused the Emperor to change his policy, if
he had not by this time so hardened himself in his false conceptions
as to be past conviction. As Marmont complains, his master had now
built up for himself an imaginary picture of the state of affairs
in the Peninsula, and argued as if the situation was what he wished
it to be, not what it actually was. ‘Il suppose vrai tout ce qu’il
voudrait trouver existant<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.’</p>

<p>A subsequent letter from Paris, dated February 21st and received
about March 2nd, contained one small amelioration of Marmont’s lot—he
was told that he might take back Bonnet’s division, and not cede
it to Dorsenne, on condition that he sent it at once to occupy the
Asturias. But it then proceeded to lay down in the harshest terms the
condemnation of the Marshal’s strategy:</p>

<p>‘The Emperor charges me to repeat to you that you worry too much
about matters with which you have no concern. Your mission was to
protect Almeida and Rodrigo—and you have let them fall. You are told
to maintain and administer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p.
210]</span> the North, and you abandon the Asturias—the only point
from which it can be dominated and contained. You are getting into
a state of alarm because Lord Wellington sends a division or two
towards Badajoz. Now Badajoz is a very strong fortress, and the Duke
of Dalmatia has 80,000 men, and can draw help from Marshal Suchet. If
Wellington were to march on Badajoz [he had done so the day before this
letter was written] you have a sure, prompt, and triumphant means of
bringing him back—that of marching on Rodrigo and Almeida.’</p>

<p>Marmont replied, with a suppressed rage that can be read between
the lines even more clearly than in his earlier letters, ‘Since the
Emperor attributes to me the fall of Almeida, which was given up before
I had actually taken over the command of this army<a id="FNanchor_238"
href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>, I cannot see what I
can do to shelter myself from censures at large: ... I am accused of
being the cause of the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo: it fell because it
had an insufficient garrison of inferior quality and a bad commandant.
Dorsenne was neither watchful nor prescient. Was it for me to take
care of a place not in my command, and separated from me by a chain
of mountains, and by the desert that had been made by the six months’
sojourn of the Army of Portugal in the valley of the Tagus?... I am
blamed for having cantoned myself in the valley of the Tagus after
repulsing Lord Wellington beyond the Coa [at the time of El Bodon],
but this was the result of the imperative orders of the Emperor, who
assigned me no other territory than the Tagus valley. Rodrigo was
occupied by troops of the Army of the North.... I have ordered General
Bonnet to reoccupy the Asturias at once, and quite see the importance
of the occupying of that province.... I am told that the Emperor thinks
that I busy myself too much about the interests of others, and not
enough about my own. I had considered that one of my duties (and one of
the most difficult of them) was to assist the Army of the South, and
that duty was formally imposed on me in some twenty dispatches, and
specially indicated by the order which bade me leave three divisions
in the valley of the Tagus. To-day I am informed that I am relieved
of that duty, and my position becomes simpler<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span> and better! But if the Emperor relies
with confidence on the effect which demonstrations in the North will
produce on the mind of Wellington, I must dare to express my contrary
opinion. Lord Wellington is quite aware that I have no magazines, and
is acquainted with the immensely difficult physical character of the
country, and its complete lack of food resources at this season. He
knows that my army is not in a position to cross the Coa, even if no
one opposes me, and that if we did so we should have to turn back at
the end of four days, unable to carry on the campaign, and with our
horses all starved to death<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.’</p>

<p>This and much more to the same effect had apparently some effect on
the mind of the Emperor. But the result was confusing when formulated
on paper. Berthier replied on March 12:</p>

<p>‘Your letters of February 27 and 28 and March 2 have been laid
before the Emperor. His Majesty thinks that not only must you
concentrate at Salamanca, but that you must throw a bridge across the
Agueda, so that, if the enemy leaves less than five divisions north
of the Tagus, you may be able to advance to the Coa, against Almeida,
and ravage all northern Portugal. If Badajoz is captured by two
divisions of the enemy its loss will not be imputed to you, the entire
responsibility will fall on the Army of the South. If the enemy leaves
only two, three, or even four divisions north of the Tagus, the Army
of Portugal will be to blame if it does not at once march against the
hostile force before it, invest Almeida, ravage all northern Portugal,
and push detachments as far as the Mondego. Its rôle is simply to
“contain” six British divisions, or at least five: it must take the
offensive in the North, or, if the enemy has taken the initiative, or
other circumstances necessitate it, must dispatch to the Tagus, by
Almaraz, the same number of divisions that Lord Wellington shall have
dispatched to conduct the siege of Badajoz.’</p>

<p>This double-edged document reached Salamanca on March 27, <i>eleven
days after Wellington had invested Badajoz</i>. The whole allied field
army had marched for Estremadura in the last days of February, and
not a single British division remained north<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span> of the Tagus. In accordance with the
Emperor’s dispatches of February 11th and of February 18th, Marmont had
already concentrated the bulk of his resources at Salamanca, drawing
in everything except Bonnet (destined for the Asturias), Souham, who
was left on the Esla to face the Army of Galicia, and the equivalent of
another division distributed as garrisons in Astorga, Leon, Palencia,
Zamora, and Valladolid. With five divisions in hand, or just coming up,
he was on the move, as the Emperor had directed, to threaten Rodrigo
and Almeida and invade northern Portugal.</p>

<p>The Paris letter of March 12, quoted above, suddenly imposed on
Marmont the choice between continuing the attack on Portugal, to which
he was committed, or of leading his whole army by Almaraz to Badajoz—it
must be the whole army, since he was told to send just as many
divisions southward as Wellington should have moved in that direction,
and every one of the seven units of the allied army had gone off.</p>

<p>Since Badajoz was stormed on April 6th, only ten days after Marmont
received on March 27 the Emperor’s dispatch of March 12, it is clear
that he never could have arrived in time to help the fortress. In June
1811 he had accomplished a similar movement at a better season of the
year, and when some time had been allowed for preparation, in fifteen
days, but only by making forced marches of the most exhausting sort. It
could not have been done in so short a time in March or April, when the
crops were not ripe, the rivers were full, and the roads were far worse
than at midsummer. Moreover (as we shall presently see) Wellington had
placed a large containing force at Merida, half-way between Almaraz and
Badajoz, which Marmont would have had to drive in—at much expense of
time.</p>

<p>The Marshal’s perplexity on receiving the dispatch that came in
upon March 27 was extreme. ‘The instructions just received,’ he wrote
to Berthier, ‘are wholly contradictory to those of February 18 and
February 21, imperative orders which forced me, against my personal
conviction, to abandon my own plan, and to make it impossible to do
what I regarded as suitable to the interests of the Emperor. The
letters of February 18 and February 21 told me that his Majesty thought
me a meddler in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span>
matters which did not concern me: he told me that it was unnecessary
for me to worry about Badajoz, “a very strong fortress supported by
an army of 80,000 men.” ... He gave me formal orders to abandon any
idea of marching to succour it, and added that if Lord Wellington went
thither, he was to be left alone, because by advancing to the Agueda
I could bring him back at once. The letters of the 18th and 21st made
it quite clear that His Majesty freed me from all responsibility for
Badajoz, provided I made a demonstration on the Agueda.... To-day your
Highness writes that I <i>am</i> responsible for Badajoz, if Lord Wellington
undertakes its siege with more than two divisions. The concluding
paragraph of your letter seems to give me permission to succour the
place, by bringing up troops to the Tagus. So, after imperative orders
have wrecked my original arrangement, which had prepared and assured an
effective help for Badajoz, and after all choice of methods has been
forbidden to me, I am suddenly given an option when it is no longer
possible to use it.... To-day, when my troops from the Tagus valley
have repassed the mountains, and used up the magazines collected there
at their departure, when it is impossible to get from Madrid the means
to establish a new magazine at Almaraz, my army, if it started from
this point [Salamanca], would consume every scrap of food that could
be procured before it could possibly reach Badajoz.... The movement
was practicable when I was in my original position: it is almost
impracticable now, considering the season of the year, and the probable
time-limit of the enemy’s operations.... After ripe reflection on the
complicated situation, considering that my main task is to hold down
the North, and that this task is much greater than that of holding the
South, taking into consideration the news that an English force is said
to be landing at Corunna (an improbable story, but one that is being
repeatedly brought me), considering that the Portuguese and Galician
troops threaten to take the offensive from Braganza, remembering that
your letters of February 18 and 21 state that Suchet’s Army of Aragon
is reckoned able to reinforce the Army of the South, and considering
that my dispositions have been made (in spite of immense preliminary
difficulties) for a fifteen days’ march on the Agueda, which is already
begun, I decide in favour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p.
214]</span> continuing that operation, though I have (as I said before)
no great confidence in its producing any effective result.</p>

<p>‘Accordingly I am putting the division that came up from the Tagus
in motion for Plasencia, with orders to spread the rumour that it
is to rejoin the army by the pass of Perales and enter Portugal; I
start from here with three more divisions for the Agueda; ... if I
fought on the Tormes I could put one more division in line, five in
all: the number of seven divisions of which the Emperor speaks could
only be concentrated if the Army of the North<a id="FNanchor_240"
href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> could send two
divisions to replace my own two now on the lines of communications and
the Esla.’</p>

<p>The recapitulation of all this correspondence may seem tedious,
but it is necessary. When it is followed with care I think that one
definite fact emerges. Napoleon was directly and personally responsible
for the fall of Badajoz. Down to March 27th Marmont was strictly
forbidden to take any precautions for the safety of that fortress, and
was censured as a meddler and an alarmist, for wishing to keep a strong
force in the valley of the Tagus, ready to march thither. On March
27 he was suddenly given an option of marching to Estremadura with
his whole army. It appears to be an option, not a definite order, for
Berthier’s sentence introducing the new scheme is alternative—the Army
of Portugal is ‘to take the offensive in the North <i>or</i>, under certain
circumstances, to march for Almaraz.’ But this point need not be
pressed, for if taken as a definite order it was impracticable: Marmont
received it so late that, if he had marched for Badajoz with the
greatest possible speed, he would have reached it some days after the
place was stormed. The fact that he believed that he would never have
got there at all, because lack of food would have stopped him on the
way, is indifferent. The essential point of Napoleon’s responsibility
is that he authorized the march too late, after having most stringently
forbidden it, in successive letters extending over several weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span>That a march
on Badajoz by the whole Army of Portugal (or so much of it as was
not required to contain the Galicians and to occupy Asturias), if
it had begun—as Marmont wished—in February or early March, would
have prevented Wellington from taking the fortress, is not certain.
A similar march in June 1811 had that effect, at the time of the
operations on the Caya. But Wellington’s position was much better
in February 1812 than it had been eight months earlier. This much,
however, is clear, that such an operation had a possible chance of
success, while Napoleon’s counter-scheme for a demonstration on the
Agueda and an invasion of the northern Beira had no such prospect.
The Emperor, for lack of comprehension of the local conditions,
misconceived its efficacy, as Marmont very cogently demonstrated in his
letters. Northern Portugal was a waste, where the Marshal’s army might
wander for a few days, but was certain to be starved before it was many
marches from the frontier. Napier, in an elaborate vindication of the
Emperor, tries to argue that the Marshal might have taken Rodrigo by
escalade without a battering-train, have assailed Almeida in similar
fashion, have menaced Oporto and occupied Coimbra<a id="FNanchor_241"
href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. He deliberately
ignores one essential condition of the war, viz. that because of the
French system of ‘living on the country,’ Marmont had no magazines,
and no transport sufficient to enable his army to conduct a long
offensive campaign in a devastated and hostile land. His paragraphs
are mere rhetoric of the most unfair kind. For example, he says,
‘Wellington with 18,000 men<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242"
class="fnanchor">[242]</a> escaladed Badajoz, a powerful fortress
defended by an excellent governor and 5,000 French veterans: Marmont
with 28,000 men would not attempt to escalade Rodrigo, although
its breaches were scarcely healed and its garrison disaffected.’
This statement omits the essential details that Wellington had a
large siege-train, had opened three broad breaches in the walls of
Badajoz, and, while the enemy was fully occupied in defending them,
escaladed distant points of the <i>enceinte</i> with success. Marmont had
no siege-train, and therefore could have made no breaches; he would
have had to cope with an undistracted garrison, holding ramparts
everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span> intact.
Moreover, Ciudad Rodrigo and its outworks form a compact fortress, of
not half the circumference of Badajoz and its dependencies. If Ney and
Masséna, with an adequate siege apparatus, treated Rodrigo with respect
in 1810, and proceeded against it by regular operations, Marmont
would have been entirely unjustified in trying the desperate method
of escalade in 1812. The fortifications, as Napier grudgingly admits,
were ‘healed’: an escalade against Carlos de España’s garrison would
certainly have met the same fate as Suchet’s assault on Saguntum, a
much weaker and unfinished stronghold. But it is unnecessary to follow
into detail Napier’s controversial statements, which are all part of a
wrong-headed scheme to prove Napoleon infallible on all occasions and
at all costs.</p>

<p>The governing facts cannot be disputed: Marmont in February placed
three divisions on the Tagus, which were to form the advanced guard
of an army that was to march to the relief of Badajoz, whose siege he
foresaw. Napoleon told him not to concern himself about Badajoz, and
compelled him to concentrate his army about Salamanca. He instructed
him that the proper reply to an attack on Badajoz by Wellington was
an invasion of northern Portugal, and gave him elaborate instructions
concerning it. Marmont reluctantly obeyed, and was starting on such an
expedition when he was suddenly told that he might move on Badajoz.
But he only received this permission ten days before that fortress
was stormed: it was therefore useless. The Emperor must take the
responsibility.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER III">SECTION XXXII: CHAPTER III</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE SIEGE OF BADAJOZ. MARCH-APRIL 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> narrating the troubles of the unlucky
Duke of Ragusa, engaged in fruitless strategical controversy with his
master, we have been carried far into the month of March 1812. It is
necessary to return to February 20th in order to take up the story of
Wellington’s march to Estremadura. We have seen that he commenced his
artillery preparations in January, by sending Alexander Dickson to
Setubal, and dispatching a large part of his siege-train southward,
partly by sea, partly across the difficult mountain roads of the
Beira.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Portuguese infantry and cavalry, however, were not moved
till the guns were far on their way. It was Wellington’s intention
to show a large army on the frontier of Leon till the last possible
moment. He himself kept his old headquarters at Freneda, near Fuentes
de Oñoro, till March 5th, in order that Marmont might be led to persist
in the belief that his attention was still concentrated on the North.
But, starting from February 19th, his divisions, one by one, had
made their unostentatious departure for the South: on the day when
he himself followed them only one division (the 5th) and one cavalry
brigade (V. Alten’s) still remained behind the Agueda. The rest were
at various stages on their way to Elvas. Most of the divisions marched
by the route Sabugal, Castello Branco, Villa Velha, Niza. But the 1st
Division went by Abrantes, in order to pick up there its clothing
for the new year, which had been brought up the Tagus in boats from
Lisbon to that point. Some of the cavalry and the two independent
Portuguese brigades of Pack and Bradford, whose winter cantonments had
been rather to the rear, had separate routes of their own, through
places so far west as Thomar<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243"
class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and Coimbra. The three<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span> brigades of the 2nd Division, under
Hill, which had been brought up to Castello Branco at the beginning of
January, were at the head of the marching army, and reached Portalegre,
via Villa Velha, long before the rest of the troops were across the
Tagus. Indeed, the first of them (Ashworth’s Portuguese) started as
early as February 2nd, and was at Castello de Vide, near Elvas, by
February 8th, before the troops behind the Agueda had begun to move<a
id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>The lengthy column of infantry which had marched by Castello
Branco and the bridge of Villa Velha was cantoned in various places
behind Elvas, from Villa Viçosa to Portalegre, by March 8th: the 1st
Division, coming in from the Abrantes direction, joined them on March
10th, and halted at Monforte and Azumar. Only the 5th Division and
the two Portuguese independent brigades were lacking, and of these
the two former were expected by the 16th, the latter by the 20th.
With the exception of the 5th Division the whole of Wellington’s
field army was concentrated near Elvas by the 16th. Only the 1st
Hussars of the King’s German Legion, under Victor Alten, had been left
to keep the outpost line in front of Ciudad Rodrigo, in order that
the French vedettes in Leon should not detect<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> that all the army of Wellington had
disappeared, as they were bound to do if only Portuguese or Spanish
cavalry showed at the front<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. Counting Hill’s corps, now long returned to
its old post in front of Badajoz, there were now nearly 60,000 troops
nearing Elvas, viz. of infantry, all the eight old Anglo-Portuguese
divisions, plus Hamilton’s Portuguese division<a id="FNanchor_246"
href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>, and Pack’s and
Bradford’s independent Portuguese brigades. Of cavalry not only were
all the old brigades assembled (save Alten’s single regiment), but
two powerful units now showed at the front for the first time. These
were the newly-landed brigade of German heavy dragoons under Bock<a
id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>,
which had arrived at Lisbon on January 1st, and Le Marchant’s brigade
of English heavy dragoons<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248"
class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, which had disembarked in the autumn, but
had not hitherto been brought up to join the field army. Of Portuguese
horse J. Campbell’s brigade was also at the front: the other Portuguese
cavalry brigade, which had served on the Leon frontier during the
preceding autumn, had been made over to General Silveira, and sent
north of the Douro. But even after deducting this small brigade of 900
sabres, Wellington’s mounted arm was immensely stronger than it had
ever been before. He had concentrated it on the Alemtejo front, in
order that he might cope on equal terms with the very powerful cavalry
of Soult’s Army of Andalusia.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief himself, travelling with his wonted speed,
left his old head-quarters at Freneda on March 5th, was at Castello
Branco on the 8th, at Portalegre on the 10th, and had reached Elvas,
his new head-quarters, on the 12th. Before leaving the North he had
made elaborate arrangements for the conduct of affairs in that quarter.
They are contained in two memoranda, given the one to Castaños,
who was still in command both of the Galician and the Estremaduran
armies of Spain, and the other to Generals Baccelar and Silveira,
of whom the former was in charge of the Portuguese department of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span> North, with
head-quarters at Oporto, and the other of the Tras-os-Montes, with
head-quarters at Villa Real<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249"
class="fnanchor">[249]</a>.</p>

<p>It was a delicate matter to leave Marmont with nothing save the
Spaniards and Portuguese in his front. Of the former the available
troops were (1) the Army of Galicia, four weak field divisions, making
about 15,000 men, of whom only 550 were cavalry, while the artillery
counted only five batteries. There were 8,000 garrison and reserve
troops in Corunna, Vigo, Ferrol, and other fortified posts to the
rear, but these were unavailable for service<a id="FNanchor_250"
href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. Abadia still commanded
the whole army, under the nominal supervision of Castaños. He had one
division (3,000 men under Cabrera) at Puebla Senabria on the Portuguese
frontier, two (9,000 men under Losada and the Conde de Belveder) at
Villafranca, observing the French garrison of Astorga and Souham’s
division on the Esla, which supported that advanced post, and one
(2,500 men under Castañon) on the Asturian frontier watching Bonnet.
(2) The second Spanish force available consisted of that section of
the Army of Estremadura, which lay north of the Sierra de Gata, viz.
Carlos de España’s division of 5,000 men, of whom 3,000 had been thrown
into Ciudad Rodrigo, so that the surplus for the field was small, and
of Julian Sanchez’s very efficient guerrillero cavalry, who were about
1,200 strong and were now counted as part of the regular army and
formally styled ‘1st and 2nd Lancers of Castille.’</p>

<p>The Portuguese troops left to defend the northern frontier were
all militia, with the exception of a couple of batteries of artillery
and the cavalry brigade of regulars which had been with Wellington
in Leon during the autumn, under Madden, but was now transferred to
Silveira’s charge, and set to watch the frontier of the Tras-os-Montes,
with the front regiment at Braganza. Silveira in that province had
the four local regiments of militia, of which each had only one
of its two battalions actually embodied. Baccelar had a much more
important force, but of the same quality, the twelve regiments<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span> forming the divisions
of Trant and J. Wilson, and comprising all the militia of the Entre
Douro e Minho province and of northern Beira. Three of these regiments
were immobilized by having been told off to serve as the garrison of
Almeida. Farther south Lecor had under arms the two militia regiments
of the Castello Branco country, watching their own district. The total
force of militia available on the whole frontier must have been about
20,000 men of very second-rate quality: each battalion had only been
under arms intermittently, for periods of six months, and the officers
were for the most part the inefficient leavings of the regular army. Of
the generals Silveira was enterprising, but over bold, as the record of
his earlier campaigns sufficiently demonstrated—Trant and Wilson had
hitherto displayed equal energy and more prudence: but in the oncoming
campaign they were convicted of Silveira’s fault, over-confidence.
Baccelar passed as a slow but fairly safe commander, rather lacking in
self-confidence.</p>

<p>Wellington’s very interesting memoranda divide the possibilities
of March-April into three heads, of which the last contains three
sub-sections:—</p>

<p>(1) Marmont may, on learning that Badajoz is in danger, march with
practically the whole of his army to succour it, as he did in May-June
1811. If this should occur, Abadia and Carlos de España will advance
and boldly take the offensive, laying siege to Astorga, Toro, Zamora,
Salamanca, and other fortified posts. Silveira will co-operate with
his cavalry and infantry, within the bounds of prudence, taking care
that his cavalry, which may support Abadia, does not lose communication
with, and a secure retreat upon, his infantry, which will not risk
itself.</p>

<p>(2) Marmont may leave a considerable force, perhaps the two
divisions of Souham and Bonnet, in Leon, while departing southward
with the greater part of his army: ‘this is the operation which it is
probable that the enemy will follow.’ What the Army of Galicia can
then accomplish will depend on the exact relative force of itself and
of the French left in front of it, and on the state of the fortified
places on the Douro and Tormes [Toro, Zamora, Salamanca] and the
degree of equipment with which General Abadia can provide himself
for siege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span>-work.
But España and Julian Sanchez must make all the play that they can,
and even Porlier and Longa, from distant Cantabria, must be asked to
co-operate in making mischief. Silveira and Baccelar will support, but
risk nothing.</p>

<p>(3) Marmont may send to Estremadura only the smaller half of his
army, and keep four or five divisions in the north, a force strong
enough to enable him to take the offensive. He may attack either (<i>a</i>)
Galicia, (<i>b</i>) Tras-os-Montes, or (<i>c</i>) the Beira, including Almeida
and Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If Marmont should invade Galicia, Abadia had better retreat,
but in the direction that will bring him near the frontiers of Portugal
(i. e. by Puebla Senabria) rather than on Lugo and Corunna. In that
case Silveira and Baccelar will be on the enemy’s flank and rear, and
will do as much mischief as they can on his communications, always
taking care that they do not, by pushing too far into Leon, lose their
communication with the Galicians or with Portugal. In proportion as the
French may advance farther into Galicia, Baccelar will take measures
to collect the whole of the militia of the Douro provinces northward.
Carlos de España and Julian Sanchez ought to have good opportunities of
making trouble for the enemy in the Salamanca district, if he pushes
far from his base.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If Marmont should invade Tras-os-Montes [not a likely
operation, owing to the roughness of the country], Baccelar and
Silveira should oppose him in front, while Abadia would come down on
his flank and rear, and annoy him as much as possible. ‘Don Carlos and
the guerrillas might do a great deal of mischief in Castille.’</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If Marmont should attack Beira, advancing by Ciudad Rodrigo
and Almeida, both these fortresses are in such a state of defence as to
ensure them against capture by a <i>coup-de-main</i>, and are supplied with
provisions to suffice during any time that the enemy could possibly
remain in the country. Baccelar and Silveira will assemble all the
militia of the northern provinces in Upper Beira, and place themselves
in communication with Carlos de España. They will endeavour to protect
the magazines on the Douro and Mondego [at Celorico, Guarda, Lamego,
St. João de Pesqueira], and may live on the last in case of urgent
necessity, but not otherwise, as these stores could not easily be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span> replaced. An attempt
should be made, if possible, to draw the enemy into the Beira Baixa
(i. e. the Castello Branco country) rather than towards the Douro.
Abadia will invade northern Leon; what he can do depends on the force
that Marmont leaves on the Esla, and the strength of his garrisons at
Astorga, Zamora, Toro, &amp;c. Supposing Marmont takes this direction,
Carlos de España will destroy before him all the bridges on the Yeltes
and Huebra, and that of Barba del Puerco, and the three bridges at
Castillejo, all on the Lower Agueda.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the alternative (2) was Marmont’s own choice,
and that he would have carried it out but for Napoleon’s orders, which
definitively imposed upon him (3<i>c</i>) the raid into northern Beira.
With the inconclusive operations resulting from that movement we shall
deal in their proper place. It began on March 27th, and the Marshal
was over the Agueda on March 30th. The last British division had left
Ciudad Rodrigo three weeks before Marmont advanced, so difficult was
it for him to get full and correct information, and to collect a
sufficiently large army for invasion. On the 26th February he was under
the impression that two British divisions only had yet marched for
Badajoz, though five had really started. On March 6th, when only the
5th Division remained in the North, he still believed that Wellington
and a large fraction of his army were in their old positions. This
was the result of his adversary’s wisdom in stopping at Freneda till
March 5th; as long as he was there in person, it was still thought
probable by the French that only a detachment had marched southward.
Hence came the lateness of Marmont’s final advance: for a long time he
might consider that he was, as his master ordered, ‘containing’ several
British divisions and the Commander-in-Chief himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on taking stock of his situation at Elvas on March
12th, Wellington was reasonably satisfied. Not only was the greater
part of his army in hand, and the rest rapidly coming up, but the
siege material had escaped all the perils of storms by sea and
rocky defiles by land, and was much where he had expected it to
be. The material which moved by road, the sixteen 24-lb. howitzers
which had marched on January 30th, and a convoy of 24-pounder and
18-pounder travelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p.
224]</span>-carriages and stores, which went off on February 2, had
both come to hand at Elvas, the first on February 25th, the second on
March 3, and were ready parked on the glacis. This was a wonderful
journey over mountain roads in the most rainy season of the year. The
sea-borne guns had also enjoyed a surprising immunity from winter
storms; Dickson, when he arrived at Setubal on February 10th, found
that the 24-pounders from Oporto had arrived thirty-six hours before
him, and on the 14th was beginning to forward them by river-boat to
Alcacer do Sal, from where they were drawn by oxen to Elvas, along
with their ammunition<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. The only difficulty which arose was that
Wellington had asked Admiral Berkeley, commanding the squadron at
Lisbon, to lend him, as a supplementary train, twenty 18-pound ship
guns. The admiral sent twenty Russian guns (leavings of Siniavins’s
squadron captured in the Tagus at the time of the Convention of
Cintra). Dickson protested, as these pieces were of a different calibre
from the British 18-pounder, and would not take its shot. The admiral
refused to disgarnish his own flagship, which happened to be the only
vessel at Lisbon with home-made 18-pounders on board. Dickson had
to take the Russian guns perforce, and to cull for their ammunition
all the Portuguese stores at Lisbon, where a certain supply of round
shot that fitted was discovered, though many thousands had to be
rejected as ‘far too low.’ On March 8th the whole fifty-two guns of
the siege-train were reported ready, and the officer commanding the
Portuguese artillery at Elvas announced that he could even find a small
supplement, six old heavy English iron guns of the time of George II,
which had been in store there since General Burgoyne’s expedition of
1761, besides some Portuguese guns of similar calibre. The old brass
guns which had made such bad practice in 1811 were not this time
requisitioned—fortunately they were not needed. The garrison of Elvas
had for some weeks been at work making gabions and fascines, which
were all ready, as was also a large consignment of cutting-tools from
the Lisbon arsenal, and a train of twenty-two pontoons. Altogether
the material was in a wonderful state of completeness.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span></p> <p>For the service
of the siege Wellington could dispose of about 300 British and 560
Portuguese artillerymen, a much larger force than had been available
at the two unlucky leaguers of 1811. Colonel Framingham was the senior
officer in this arm present, but Wellington had directed that Alexander
Dickson should take charge of the whole service of the siege, just as
he had been entrusted with all the preparations for it. There were
fifteen British, five German Legion, and seventeen Portuguese artillery
officers under his command. The Portuguese gunners mostly came from
the 3rd or Elvas regiment, the British were drawn from the companies
of Holcombe, Gardiner, Glubb, and Rettberg.<a id="FNanchor_252"
href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Under Colonel Fletcher,
senior engineer officer, there were 115 men of the Royal Military
Artificers present at the commencement of the siege, and an additional
party came up from Cadiz during its last days. But though this was
an improvement over the state of things in 1811, the numbers were
still far too small; there were no trained miners whatever, and the
volunteers from the line acting as sappers, who were instructed by the
Artificers, were for the most part unskilful—only 120 men of the 3rd
Division who had been at work during the leaguer of Ciudad Rodrigo were
comparatively efficient. The engineer arm was the weak point in the
siege, as Wellington complained in a letter which will have to be dealt
with in its proper place. He had already been urging on Lord Liverpool
the absolute necessity for the creation of permanent units of men
trained in the technicalities of siege-work. Soon after Rodrigo fell
he wrote, ‘I would beg to suggest to your lordship the expediency of
adding to the Engineer establishment a corps of sappers and miners. It
is inconceivable with what disadvantage we undertake a siege, for want
of assistance of this description. There is no French <i>corps d’armée</i>
which has not a battalion of sappers and a company of miners. We are
obliged to depend for assistance of this sort upon the regiments of
the line; and, although the men are brave and willing, they want the
knowledge and training which are necessary. Many casualties occur, and
much valuable time is lost at the most critical period of the siege<a
id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>,’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>The situation
on March 12th, save in this single respect, seemed favourable. It was
only fourteen miles from Elvas, where the siege-train lay parked and
the material was ready, to Badajoz. Sufficient troops were already
arrived not only to invest the place, but to form a large covering
army against any attempt of Soult to raise the siege. There was every
reason to believe that the advance would take the French unawares.
Only Drouet’s two divisions were in Estremadura, and before they
could be reinforced up to a strength which would enable them to act
with effect some weeks must elapse. Soult, as in 1811, would have to
borrow troops from Granada and the Cadiz Lines before he could venture
to take the offensive. Unless he should raise the siege of Cadiz or
evacuate Granada, he could not gather more than 25,000 or 30,000 men at
the very most: and it would take him three weeks to collect so many.
If he approached with some such force, he could be fought, with very
little risk: for it was not now as at the time of Albuera: not three
Anglo-Portuguese infantry divisions, but eight were concentrated at
Elvas: there would be nine when the 5th Division arrived. Not three
British cavalry regiments (the weak point at Albuera), but fourteen
were with the army. If Soult should push forward for a battle,
40,000 men could be opposed to him, all Anglo-Portuguese units of
old formation, while 15,000 men were left to invest Badajoz. Or if
Wellington should choose to abandon the investment for three days
(as Beresford had done in May 1811) he could bring 55,000 men to the
contest, a force which must crush Soult by the force of double numbers,
unless he should raise the siege of Cadiz and abandon Granada, so as to
bring his whole army to the Guadiana. Even if he took that desperate,
but perhaps necessary, measure, and came with 45,000 men, leaving only
Seville garrisoned behind him, there was no reason to suppose that he
could not be dealt with.</p>

<p>The only dangerous possibility was the intervention of Marmont with
five or six divisions of the Army of Portugal, as had happened at the
time of the operations on the Caya in June 1811. Wellington, as we
have seen in his directions to Baccelar and Castaños, thought this
intervention probable. But from the disposition of Marmont’s troops
at the moment of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p.
227]</span> departure from Freneda, he thought that he could count on
three weeks, or a little more, of freedom from any interference from
this side. Two at least of Marmont’s divisions (Souham and Bonnet)
would almost certainly be left in the North, to contain the Galicians
and Asturians. Of the other six only one (Foy) was in the valley
of the Tagus: the rest were scattered about, at Salamanca, Avila,
Valladolid, &amp;c., and would take time to collect<a id="FNanchor_254"
href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. Wellington was quite
aware of Marmont’s difficulties with regard to magazines; he also
counted on the roughness of the roads, the fact that the rivers were
high in March, and (most of all) on the slowness with which information
would reach the French marshal<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255"
class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. Still, here lay the risk, so far as
Wellington could know. What he could not guess was that the movement
which he feared had been expressly forbidden to Marmont by his master,
and that only on March 27th was permission granted to the Marshal to
execute the march to Almaraz. By that time, as we have already seen, it
was too late for him to profit by the tardily-granted leave.</p>

<p>But it was the possibility of Marmont’s appearance on the scene,
rather than anything which might be feared from Soult, which made
the siege of Badajoz a time-problem, just as that of Ciudad Rodrigo
had been. The place must, if possible, be taken somewhere about the
first week in April, the earliest date at which a serious attempt at
relief was likely to be made<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.</p>

<p>On March 14th, every preparation being complete, the pontoon
train, with a good escort, moved out of Elvas, and was brought up
to a point on the Guadiana four miles west of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span> Badajoz, where it was laid without
molestation. On the next day Le Marchant’s heavy dragoons crossed, but
(owing to an accident to one of the boats) no more troops. On the 16th,
however, the 3rd, 4th, and Light Divisions passed, and invested Badajoz
without meeting any opposition: the garrison kept within the walls,
and did not even prevent Colonel Fletcher, the commanding engineer,
from approaching for purposes of reconnaissance to the crest of the
Cerro de San Miguel, only 200 yards from the <i>enceinte</i>. The investing
corps of 12,000 bayonets was under Beresford, who had just returned
from a short and stormy visit to Lisbon, where he had been harrying the
regency, at Wellington’s request, upon financial matters, and had been
dealing sternly with the Junta de Viveres, or Commissariat Department<a
id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.
The situation had not been found a happy one. ‘After a perfect
investigation it appears that the expenditure must be nearly
£6,000,000—the means at present are £3,500,000! A radical reform
grounded upon a bold and fearless inquiry into every branch of the
revenue, expenditure, and subsidy, and an addition to the latter
from England, can alone put a period to these evils. To this Lord
Wellington, though late, is now turning his eyes. And when the Marshal,
in conjunction with our ambassador, shall have made his report, it
must be <i>immediately</i> acted upon—for there is no time to lose<a
id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>.’</p>

<p>The investment was only part of the general movements of the army on
the 16th. The covering-force was proceeding to take up its position in
two sections. Graham with the 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, and Slade’s
and Le Marchant’s horse, crossed the Guadiana, and began to advance
down the high road to Seville, making for Santa Marta and Villafranca.
Hill with the other section, consisting of his own old troops of
the Estremaduran army, the 2nd Division and Hamilton’s Portuguese,
Long’s British and Campbell’s Portuguese cavalry, marched by the north
bank of the Guadiana, via Montijo, towards<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span> Merida, which had not been occupied by
either party since January 17th. These two columns, the one 19,000, the
other 14,000 strong, were to drive in the two French divisions which
were at this moment cantoned in Estremadura—Drouet was known to be
lying about Zafra and Llerena, covering the Seville <i>chaussée</i>, Daricau
to have his troops at Zalamea and Los Hornachos, watching the great
passage of the Guadiana at Merida. As each division with its attendant
cavalry was not much over 6,000 strong, there was no danger of their
combining so as to endanger either of the British columns. Each was
strong enough to give a good account of itself. Hill and Graham were to
push forward boldly, and drive their respective enemies before them as
far as the Sierra Morena, so that Soult, when he should come up from
Seville (as he undoubtedly would in the course of a few weeks), should
have no foothold in the Estremaduran plain to start from, and would
have to manœuvre back the containing force in his front all the way
from the summit of the passes to Albuera.</p>

<p>In addition to these two columns and the investing corps at Badajoz,
Wellington had a reserve of which some units had not yet come up,
though all were due in a few days, viz. the 5th Division, Pack’s and
Bradford’s independent Portuguese brigades, and the cavalry of Bock and
Anson—about 12,000 men—: the last of them would be up by the 21st at
latest.</p>

<p>There was still one more corps from which Wellington intended to
get useful assistance. This was the main body of the Spanish Army
of Estremadura, the troops of Penne Villemur and Morillo, about
1,000 horse and 4,000 foot<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259"
class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, which he destined to play the same part
in this campaign that Blake had played during the last siege of
Badajoz. By Castaños’s leave this little force had been moved from
its usual haunts by Caçeres and Valencia de Alcantara, behind the
Portuguese frontier, to the Lower Guadiana, from whence it was to
enter the Condado de Niebla. It passed Redondo on March 17th on its
way towards San Lucar de Guadiana, feeding on magazines provided by
its allies; Penne Villemur’s orders were that he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span> should establish himself in the Condado
(where there was still a small Spanish garrison at Ayamonte), and
strike at Seville, the moment that he heard that Soult had gone
north towards Estremadura. The city would be found ill-garrisoned by
convalescents, and <i>Juramentados</i> of doubtful loyalty: if it were not
captured, its danger would at any rate cause Soult to turn back, just
as he had in June 1811, for he dared not lose his base and arsenal. It
was hoped that Ballasteros with his roving corps from the mountain of
Ronda would co-operate, when he found that the troops usually employed
to ‘contain’ him had marched off. But Ballasteros was always a ‘law
unto himself,’ and it was impossible to count upon him: he particularly
disliked suggestions from a British quarter, while Castaños was
always sensible and obliging<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"
class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the operations of the actual siege of Badajoz,
which require to be studied in continuous sequence, it may be well to
deal with those of the covering corps.</p>

<p>Graham marched in two columns, one division by Albuera, two by
Almendral. He ran against the outposts of Drouet at Santa Marta, from
which a battalion and a few cavalry hastily retired to Villafranca,
where it was reported that Drouet himself was lying. Graham judged
that the French general would probably retire towards Llerena by the
main road, and hoped to harass, if not to surprise him, by a forced
night march on that place. This was executed in the night of the
18th-19th, but proved a disappointment: the vanguard of the British
column entered Llerena only to find it empty—Drouet had retired
not southward but eastward, so as to get into touch with Daricau’s
division at Zalamea—he had gone off by Ribera to Los Hornachos. Graham
thereupon halted his main body at Zafra, with the cavalry out as far
as Usagre and Fuente Cantos. A dispatch from Drouet to his brigadier
Reymond was intercepted on the 21st, and showed that the latter,
with four battalions at Fregenal, had been cut off from his chief by
the irruption of the British down the high-road, and was ordered to
rejoin him by way of Llerena. Graham thought that he might catch this
little force, so withdrew his cavalry from Llerena, in order that
Reymond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> might
make his way thither unmolested, and be caught in a trap by several
British brigades converging upon him by a night march. This operation,
executed on the night of the 25th, unfortunately miscarried. The French
actually entered Llerena, but as the columns were closing in upon them
an unlucky accident occurred. Graham and his staff, riding ahead of
the 7th Division, ran into a cavalry picket, which charged them. They
came back helter-skelter on to the leading battalion of the infantry,
which fired promiscuously into the mass, killed two staff officers,
and nearly shot their general<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"
class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. The noise of this outburst of fire, and
the return of their own dragoons, warned the 1,800 French in Llerena,
who escaped by a mountain path towards Guadalcanal, and did not lose a
man.</p>

<p>Improbable as it would have been judged, Drouet had abandoned the
Seville road altogether, and gone off eastward. His only communication
with Soult would have to be by Cordova: clearly he had refused to
be cut off from Daricau: possibly he may have hoped to await in the
direction of Zalamea and Castuera the arrival of troops from the Army
of Portugal, coming down by Truxillo and Medellin from Almaraz. For
Soult and his generals appear to have had no notice of the Emperor’s
prohibition to Marmont to send troops to Estremadura. On the other
hand the Duke of Ragusa had written, in perfect good faith, before
he received the imperial rescript, that he should come to the aid of
Badajoz with four or five divisions, as in June 1811, if the place were
threatened.</p>

<p>On the 27th Graham resolved to pursue Drouet eastward, even hoping
that he might slip in to the south of him, and drive him northward
in the direction of Merida and Medellin, where he would have fallen
into the arms of Hill’s column. He had reached Llera and La Higuera
when he intercepted another letter—this time from General Reymond to
Drouet; that officer, after escaping from Llerena on the night of the
25th-26th, had marched to Azuaga, where he had picked up another<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span> detachment under General
Quiot. He announced that he was making the best of his way towards
Fuente Ovejuna, behind the main crest of the Sierra Morena, by which
circuitous route he hoped to join his chief.</p>

<p>Graham thought that he had now another opportunity of surprising
Reymond, while he was marching across his front, and swerving southward
again made a second forced night march on Azuaga. It failed, like that
on Llerena three days before—the French, warned by <i>Afrancesados</i>, left
in haste, and Graham’s exhausted troops only arrived in time to see
them disappear.</p>

<p>Reymond’s column was joined next day at Fuente Ovejuna by Drouet
and Daricau, so that the whole of the French force in Estremadura was
now concentrated—but in an unfavourable position, since they were
completely cut off from Seville, and could only retire on Cordova if
further pressed. Should Soult wish to join them with his reserves, he
would have to march up the Guadalquivir, losing four or five days.</p>

<p>Graham and his staff were flattering themselves that they had won
a considerable strategical advantage in this matter, when they were
disappointed, by receiving, on March 30, a dispatch from Wellington
prohibiting any further pursuit of Drouet, or any longer stay on the
slopes of the Sierra Morena. The column was ordered to come back and
canton itself about Fuente del Maestre, Almendralejo, and Villafranca.
By April 2nd the three divisions were established in these places.
Their recall would seem to have been caused by Wellington’s knowledge
that Soult had by now concentrated a heavy force at Seville, and that
if he advanced suddenly by the great <i>chaussée</i>, past Monasterio and
Fuente Cantos, Graham might be caught in a very advanced position
between him and Drouet, and find a difficulty in retreating to join the
main body of the army for a defensive battle on the Albuera position<a
id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hill, with the other half of the covering army, had
been spending a less eventful fortnight. He reached Merida<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span> on March 17 and found
it unoccupied. Drouet was reported to be at Villafranca, Daricau to
be lying with his troops spread wide between Medellin, Los Hornachos,
and Zalamea. Hill crossed the Guadiana and marched to look for them:
his first march was on Villafranca, but Drouet had already slipped
away from that point, avoiding Graham’s column. Hill then turned in
search of Daricau, and drove one of his brigades out of Don Benito
near Medellin. The bulk of the French division then went off to the
south-east, and ultimately joined Drouet at Fuente Ovejuna, though it
kept a rearguard at Castuera. Hill did not pursue, but remained in the
neighbourhood of Merida and Medellin, to guard these two great passages
of the Guadiana against any possible appearance of Marmont’s troops
from the direction of Almaraz and Truxillo. Wellington (it will be
remembered) had believed that Marmont would certainly come down with
a considerable force by this route, and (being ignorant of Napoleon’s
order to the Marshal) was expecting him to be heard of from day to day.
As a matter of fact only Foy’s single division was in the Tagus valley
at Talavera: that officer kept receiving dispatches for his chief from
Drouet and Soult, imploring that Marmont should move south without
delay. This was impossible, as Foy knew; but he became so troubled
by the repeated requests that he thought of marching, on his own
responsibility, to try to join Drouet. This became almost impracticable
when Drouet and Daricau withdrew southward to the borders of Andalusia:
but Foy then thought of executing a demonstration on Truxillo, on
his own account, hoping that it might at least distract Wellington.
On April 4 he wrote to Drouet that he was about to give out that he
was Marmont’s advanced guard, and to march, with 3,000 men only, on
that point, leaving the rest of his division in garrison at Talavera
and Almaraz; he would be at Truxillo on the 9th<a id="FNanchor_263"
href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. If he had started a
week earlier, he would have fallen into the hands of Hill, who was
waiting for him at Merida with four times his force. But the news of
the fall of Badajoz on the 6th reached him in time to prevent him from
running into the lion’s mouth. Otherwise, considering Hill’s enterprise
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span> Foy’s complete
lack of cavalry, there might probably have been something like a
repetition of the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos.</p>

<p>So much for the covering armies—it now remains to be seen how
Wellington dealt with Badajoz, in the three weeks during which Graham
and Hill were keeping the peace for him in southern and eastern
Estremadura.</p>

<p>On surveying the fortress upon March 16th the British engineers
found that it had been considerably strengthened since the last siege
in June 1811. Fort San Cristobal had been vastly improved—its glacis
and counterscarp had been raised, and a strong redoubt (called by the
French the Lunette Werlé, after the general killed at Albuera) had been
thrown up on the rising slope where Beresford’s breaching batteries
had stood, so that this ground would have to be won before it could be
again utilized. On the southern side of the Guadiana the Castle had
been provided with many more guns, and some parts of the precipitous
mound on which it stood had been scarped. The breach of 1811 had been
most solidly built up. No danger was feared in this quarter—it was
regarded as the strongest part of the defences. The approach toward
the much more accessible bastions just below the Castle had been made
difficult, by damming the Rivillas stream: its bridge near the San
Roque gate had been built up, and the accumulated water made a broad
pool which lay under the bastions of San Pedro and La Trinidad; its
overflow had been turned into the ditch in front of San Pedro, and, by
cutting a <i>cunette</i> or channel, a deep but narrow water obstruction had
been formed in front of the Trinidad also—the broad dry ditch having a
narrow wet ditch sunk in its bottom just below the counterscarp. This
inundation was destined to give great trouble to the besiegers. The
Pardaleras fort had been connected with the city by a well-protected
trench between high earthen banks. Finally the three bastions on the
south side next the river, San Vincente, San José, and Santiago, had
been strengthened by demi-lunes, which they had hitherto lacked, and
also by driving a system of mines from their counterscarps under the
glacis: these were to be exploded if the besiegers should push up their
trenches and breaching batteries close to the walls on this side,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span> was one of
the weakest in the city, since it was not covered, as were the other
fronts, by outlying works like the Pardaleras and Picurina forts or the
San Roque lunette. The existence of this series of mines was revealed
to the besiegers by a French sergeant-major of sappers, a skilful
draughtsman, who had been employed in mapping out the works. Having
been insulted, as he conceived, by his captain, and refused redress by
the governor, he fled to the British camp in a rage, and placed his
map (where the mines are very clearly shown) and his services at the
disposition of Wellington<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. The identical map, a very neat piece of
work, lies before me as I write these lines, having passed into the
possession of General D’Urban, the chief of the Portuguese staff.
It was in consequence of their knowledge of these defences that the
British engineers left the San Vincente front alone<a id="FNanchor_265"
href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

<p>The garrison on March 15th consisted of five battalions of French
regulars, one each from certain regiments belonging to Conroux,
Leval, Drouet, and Daricau (2,767 men), of two battalions of the
Hesse-Darmstadt regiment of the Rheinbund division of the Army of the
Centre (910 men), three companies of artillery (261 men), two and a
half companies of sappers (260 men), a handful of cavalry (42 men),
a company of Spanish Juramentados, and (by casual chance) the escort
of a convoy which had entered the city two days before the siege
began. The whole (excluding non-combatants, medical and commissariat
staff, &amp;c.) made up 4,700 men, not more than an adequate provision
for such a large place. The governor, Phillipon, the commandants of
artillery and engineers (the last-named, Lamare, was the historian
of the three sieges of Badajoz), and nearly all the staff had been
in the fortress for more than a year. The battalions of the garrison
(though not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span> the
same as those who had sustained the assaults of 1811) had been many
months settled in the place, and knew it almost as well as did the
staff. They were all picked troops, including the German regiment,
which had an excellent record. But undoubtedly the greatest factor
in the defence was the ingenuity and resource of the governor, which
surpassed all praise: oddly enough Phillipon did not show himself a
very skilful mover of troops in the field, when commanding a division
in the Army of Germany in 1813, after his capture and exchange: but
behind the walls of Badajoz he was unsurpassable<a id="FNanchor_266"
href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>The scheme of attack which Wellington, under the advice of his
engineers, employed against Badajoz in March 1812 differed entirely
from that of May-June 1811. The fact that the whole was a time-problem
remained the same: the danger that several of the French armies might,
if leisure were granted them, unite for its relief, was as clear as
ever. But the idea that the best method of procedure was to assail
the most commanding points of the fortress, whose capture would make
the rest untenable, was completely abandoned. Fort San Cristobal and
the lofty Castle were on this occasion to be left alone altogether.
The former was only observed by a single Portuguese brigade (first
Da Costa’s and later Power’s). The second was not breached, or even
battered with any serious intent. This time the front of attack was to
be the bastions of Santa Maria and La Trinidad, on the south-eastern
side of the town. The reason for leaving those of San Vincente and
San José, on the south-western side, unassailed—though they were more
accessible, and defended by no outer forts—was apparently the report
of the renegade French sergeant-major spoken of above; ‘they were
countermined, and therefore three or four successive lodgements would
have to be formed against them<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267"
class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.’ To attack Santa Maria and the Trinidad a
preliminary operation was necessary—they were covered by the Picurina
fort, and only from the knoll on which that work stands could they be
battered with effect. The Picurina was far weaker<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span> than the Pardaleras fort, from whose site
a similar advantage could be got against the bastions of San Roque and
San Juan. It must therefore be stormed, and on its emplacement would
be fixed the batteries of the second parallel, which were to do the
main work of breaching. The exceptional advantage to be secured in
this way was that the counterguard (inner protective bank) within the
<i>glacis</i> of the Trinidad bastion was reputed to be so low, that from
the Picurina knoll the scarp of the bastion could be seen almost to its
foot, and could be much more effectively battered than any part of the
defences whose upper section alone was visible to the besieger.</p>

<p>Despite, therefore, of the need for wasting no time, and of the fact
that the preliminary operations against the Picurina must cost a day or
two, this was the general plan of attack adopted. The investment had
been completed on the evening of the 16th: on the same day 120 carts
with stores of all kinds marched from Elvas, and on the 17th these were
already being deposited in the Engineers’ Park, behind the Cerro de San
Miguel, whose rounded top completely screened the preparations from the
sight of the garrison.</p>

<p>The besieged had no notion whatever as to the front which would,
on this third attempt, be selected for the attack of the British. The
elaborate fortifications and improvements made in the Castle and San
Cristobal tend to show that these old points of attack were expected
to be once more assailed. Hence the besiegers got the inestimable
advantage of an unmolested start on the night of March 17th. Colonel
Fletcher had risked the dangers of drawing the first parallel at a very
short distance from the Picurina fort. On a night of tempestuous rain
and high wind, a parallel 600 yards long was picketed out, on a line
ranging only from 160 to 200 yards from the covered-way of the work,
and 1,800 workmen in the course of the night threw up the parallel, and
4,000 feet of a communication-trench, leading backward to the head of
a ravine in the hill of San Miguel, which gave good cover for bringing
men and material up from the rear. Not a shot was fired by the French
all through the night, and at dawn the parallel and approach were
already 3 feet deep and 3 feet 6 inches wide—a good start.</p>

<p>With daylight the enemy discovered what had been done,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span> and opened a furious
fire both of cannon and musketry upon the trenches. The three nearest
bastions of the fortress joined in with their heavy guns, but the 18th
was a day of such constant rain that even at a distance of only 500
or 600 yards it was impossible to see much, or take accurate aim at
the trenches. The working parties went on deepening and improving the
parallel and the communication behind it, without suffering any great
loss.</p>

<p>During the night of the 18th-19th they were able to trace out and
begin two batteries, destined to breach the Picurina, in the line of
the parallel, and to extend it at both ends, from the Rivillas on one
side to the foot of the hill of San Miguel on the other.</p>

<p>This was visible on the following morning, and Phillipon thought
the prospects of the fort so bad that he resolved to risk a sortie, to
destroy at all costs the trenches which were so dangerously near to
their objective. At midday two battalions—1,000 men—starting from the
lunette of San Roque, dashed up the hill, got into the north end of the
parallel, and drove out the working parties for a distance of some 500
yards: they carried off many entrenching tools, for which the governor
had offered the <i>bonus</i> of one dollar a piece. But they had no time to
do any serious damage to the parallel, for the guard of the trenches
and the working parties, rallying fifty yards up the hill, came down
on them in force, within a quarter of an hour, and evicted them again
after a sharp tussle. The loss on the two sides was very different—the
British lost 150 men, the besieged 304, of whom many were drowned in
the inundation, while trying to take short cuts through it to the
gates. The effect of the sortie had been practically <i>nil</i>, as far as
destroying the works went. During this skirmish Colonel Fletcher was
wounded in the groin by a ball, which hit his purse, and while failing
to penetrate further, forced a dollar-piece an inch into his thigh. He
was confined to his tent for some fourteen days, and his subordinates,
Majors Squire and Burgoyne, had to take up his duty, though Wellington
ordered that he should still retain nominal charge of the work, and
consulted him daily upon it.</p>

<p>On the next night (March 20th) the parallel and approach against the
Picurina being practically complete, and only the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span> battery emplacements in it requiring to
be finished, the engineers of the besieging army resolved to continue
the line of trenches into the flat ground in front of the Bastion of
San Pedro and the Castle, it being intended that batteries should be
constructed here to play on the Trinidad and the neighbouring parts
of the fortress, when the Picurina should have fallen. It would save
time to have everything ready on this side, when the fort should have
been mastered. Trouble at once began—not only from the enemy’s fire,
which swept all this low ground, but still more from the continuous
bad weather. The rain which had easily run away from the sloping
trenches on the Cerro de San Miguel, lodged in the new works, could
not be drained off, and melted away the earth as fast as it was thrown
up. Mud cast into the gabions ran off in the form of slimy water, and
the parapets could only be kept upright by building them of sandbags.
The men were actually flooded out of the trenches by the accumulated
water, which was almost knee deep. In the rear the Guadiana rose, and
washed away the two bridges which connected the army with its base at
Elvas. The deluge lasted four days and was a terrible hindrance, it
being impossible to finish the parallel in the low ground, or to begin
moving the battering-guns, even those destined for the long-completed
batteries on the Cerro de San Miguel.</p>

<p>It was not till the afternoon of the 24th that fine weather at last
set in; this permitted the guns to be brought at once into the two
batteries facing the Picurina, and, after herculean efforts, into other
batteries (nos. 4 and 5) in the low ground also. Three days at least
had been lost from the vile weather.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th all the batteries opened simultaneously,
ten guns against the Picurina, eighteen against the parts of the
fortress behind it. The fort was completely silenced, as was the little
lunette of San Roque. Not much damage appeared to have been inflicted
on the Picurina beyond the breaking of many of its palisades, and the
degradation of its salient angle. But Wellington ordered that it should
be stormed that night, in order that he might make up for the lost time
of the 20th-24th.</p>

<p>The storm was duly carried out by General Kempt and 500 men of the
Light and the 3rd Divisions, at ten o’clock that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span> night. It was a desperate affair, for the
ditch was deep, and not in the least filled with rubbish, and the scarp
was intact save at the extreme salient angle. Though the garrison’s
guns had been silenced, they kept up a furious fire of musketry, which
disabled 100 men before the stormers reached the ditch. The main hope
of the assault had been that two turning columns might break in at
the gorge: but it was found so strongly closed, with a double row
of palisades and a cutting, that all efforts to force an entrance
were repelled with loss. Baffled here, one party tried the desperate
expedient of casting three long ladders, not into, but <i>across</i> the
ditch on the right flank of the fort, which though deep was not so
broad but that a 30-foot ladder would reach from its lip to the row
of fraises, or projecting beams, ranged horizontally at the top of
the scarp some feet below the brim of the parapet. The ladders sagged
down but did not break, and some fifty men headed by Captain Oates of
the 88th ran across on the rungs and got a lodgement inside the fort.
At the same moment General Kempt launched the reserve of the storming
party—100 men, mostly from the 2/83rd and headed by Captain Powys of
that regiment—at the exact salient of the fort, the only place where it
was seriously damaged, and succeeded in breaking in. The garrison, who
made a stubborn resistance, were overpowered—83 were killed or wounded,
the governor, Colonel Gaspard-Thierry, and 145 taken prisoners, only 1
officer and 40 men escaped into the town. The losses of the stormers
had been over 50 per cent. of the men engaged! Four officers and 50
rank and file were killed, 15 officers and 250 men wounded, out of a
little over 500 who joined in the assault. Phillipon tried a sortie
from the lunette of San Roque, just as the fort fell, in hopes to
recover it: but the battalion which came out was easily beaten off by
the fire of the men in the trenches to the right, and lost 50 killed
and wounded.</p>

<p>The last stage of the siege had now been reached. By capturing
the Picurina on its commanding knoll, the British had established
themselves within 400 yards of the Trinidad and 450 yards of the Santa
Maria bastions, which they could batter with every advantage of slope
and ground. But it was a very costly business to make the necessary
lodgement in the ruined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p.
241]</span> fort, to demolish it, and throw its earth in the reverse
direction, and to build in its gorge the two batteries (nos. 8, 9),
which were to breach the body of the place. The fire of three bastions
bore directly on the spot where the batteries were to be placed, and
there was also a most deadly enfilading fire from the high-lying
Castle, and even from the distant San Cristobal. Though the three
batteries in the flat ground (to which a fourth was presently added)
endeavoured to silence this fire, they only succeeded in doing so very
imperfectly, for the French kept replacing one gun by another, from
their ample store, when any were disabled. From the 26th to the 30th
four days were employed in building the Picurina batteries, with great
loss of life all the time, which fell mainly on the engineer officers
who were directing the work and on the sappers under their orders. The
French covered the whole of the Picurina knoll with such a hail of
projectiles that no amount of cover seemed to guarantee those labouring
in it from sudden death. When the batteries had been completed, the
bringing forward of the guns and the ammunition cost many lives more.
Twice there were considerable explosions of powder, while the magazines
in the batteries were being filled.</p>

<p>At last, however, on March 30, one of the two new batteries in the
gorge of the Picurina was able to open, and on the 31st the other
followed suit, supported by a third supplementary battery (no. 7),
planned under the left flank of the fort. The practice was excellent,
but at first the effect was not all that had been hoped: the Trinidad
and the Santa Maria bastions were solidly built and resisted well. On
April 2, however, both began to show considerable and obvious injury,
and it was clear that a few days more would ruin them. But there was
one serious <i>contretemps</i>: the inundation between the Picurina and
the fortress showed no signs of going down—it had been swollen by the
rains of the 20th-24th, and could not flow away so long as the dam at
the lunette of San Roque kept it back. While the water was held up,
the breaches, soon about to develop, could only be got at by a narrow
and curved route, between the inundation and the steep slope on which
stands the Pardaleras. It had been intended that the assault should be
delivered from the trenches, but this was impossible till the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> Rivillas should have
fallen to its usual insignificant breadth and depth. Hence efforts were
made to burst the dam at all costs, but neither did artillery fire
suffice, nor a venturesome expedition on the night of the 2nd of April
by the engineer Lieutenant Stanway and 20 sappers, who slipped down
the ravine and laid powder-bags against the dam, despite of the French
fire. The powder exploded, but did not do its work. For several days an
attempt was made to sap down to the dam from the second parallel. But
it cost so many lives at the head of the sap, and the zig-zags advanced
so slowly, that on the 3rd of April the attempt was given up, and it
was determined that the breaches must be assaulted from the west bank
of the Rivillas only.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two breaches, the larger one in the front of the
Trinidad bastion, the smaller in the flank of the Santa Maria, began
to be very apparent, and gave good hope to the besiegers. The French,
however, delayed their progress by the most gallant efforts: 200 men
worked in the ditch after dark, to clear away the débris that was
falling into it. This they did under constant artillery fire from
the batteries, which played on the ditch with grape at intervals in
the night, and killed scores of the workmen. They also deepened the
ditch at the foot of the counterscarp, till it was 18 feet from the
covered-way to the bottom of its level. The ruined parapets were built
up every night with earth and wool-packs, only to be destroyed again
every morning. The garrison began to feel uncomfortable, for not only
was the loss of life great, but the furious fire, by which they strove
to keep down the efficiency of the siege-batteries, had begun to tell
so much on their reserves of ammunition that, by April 3, there was
no common shell left, and very little grape—of the round-shot much
more than half had been expended. Phillipon was obliged to order
the artillerymen to be sparing, or a few days more would leave him
helpless. As the French fire slackened, that of the besiegers grew
more intense, and Wellington put forward the last twelve guns of his
siege-park, hitherto reserved, to form some new supplementary batteries
on the right of his line [nos. 10, 11, 12].</p>

<p>On April 4th the breaches were both growing practicable, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span> news from the South
warned Wellington that he must hurry; Soult was at last over the
Sierra Morena with all the troops that he could scrape together from
Andalusia. It was lucky indeed that Marmont was not marching to join
Soult, but was executing a raid into central Portugal, not by his
own wish but by the special orders of the Emperor, as has already
been explained elsewhere. His irruption into the Beira was absolutely
disregarded by Wellington: for as long as the two French armies were
not united, the British commander did not much fear either of them.
Still, if Soult came close up to Badajoz, it would be necessary to send
part of the siege-troops to join the covering force—and this would be
inconvenient. Wherefore Wellington resolved to strike at once, while
Soult was still four or five marches away.</p>

<p>On the 4th the breaches, both in the Trinidad and in Santa Maria,
looked practicable—on the morning of the 5th they were certainly so.
But the question was raised as to whether the mere practicability of
the breaches was enough to ensure success—it was clearly made out that
the garrisons were building a semicircular inner retrenchment among the
houses of the town, which would cut off the breaches, and give a second
line of resistance. Moreover Colonel Fletcher, who was just out of bed,
his wound of the 19th March being on the mend, reported from personal
observation that it was clear that all manner of obstacles were being
accumulated behind both breaches, and every preparation made for a
desperate defence of them. Wherefore Wellington ordered the storm to
be put off for a day, and turned two batteries on to a new spot, where
Spanish informants reported that the wall of the curtain was badly
built, between Santa Maria and the Trinidad. So true was this report,
that a very few hours battering on the morning of the 6th made a third
breach at this point, as practicable as either of the others.</p>

<p>To prevent the enemy from getting time to retrench this third
opening into the town, the storm was ordered for 7.30 o’clock on the
same evening—it would have been well if the hour had been kept as first
settled.</p>

  <p class="subh3">THE STORM OF BADAJOZ. APRIL 6, 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrangements which Wellington made
for the assault—a business which he knew would be costly, and not
absolutely certain of success—were as follows.</p>

<p>The Light and 4th Divisions were told off for the main attack at
the three breaches. They were forced to make it on the narrow front
west of the Rivillas, because the inundation cramped their approach
on the right. The 4th Division, under Colville, was to keep nearest
to that water, and to assail the breach in the Trinidad bastion and
also the new breach in the curtain to its left. The Light Division
was to devote itself to the breach in the flank of Santa Maria. Each
division was to provide an advance of 500 men, with which went twelve
ladders and a party carrying hay-bags to cast into the ditch. For the
counterscarp not being ruined, it was clear that there would be a very
deep jump into the depths. The two divisions followed in columns of
brigades, each with a British brigade leading, the Portuguese in the
centre, and the other British brigade in the rear. Neither division
was quite complete—the 4th having to provide the guard of the trenches
that night, while the Light Division detached some of its rifles, to
distract the attention of the enemy in the bastions to the left, by
lying down on the glacis and firing into the embrasures when their
cannon should open. Hence the Light Division put only 3,000, the 4th
3,500 men into the assault. When the breaches were carried, the Light
Division was to wheel to the left, the 4th to the right, and to sweep
along the neighbouring bastions on each side. A reserve was to be left
at the quarries below the Pardaleras height, and called up when it was
needed.</p>

<p>In addition to the main assault two subsidiary attacks were to
be made—a third (as we shall see) was added at the last moment. The
guards of the trenches, furnished by the 4th<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span> Division, were to try to rush the lunette
of San Roque, which was in a dilapidated condition, and were to cut
away the dam if successful. A much more serious matter was that, on the
express petition of General Picton, he was allowed to make an attempt
to take the Castle by <i>escalade</i>. This daring officer argued that all
the attention of the enemy would be concentrated on the breaches,
and that the Castle was in itself so strong that it was probable the
governor would only leave a minimum garrison in it. He had marked spots
in its front where the walls were comparatively low, owing to the way
in which the rocky and grassy slope at its foot ran up and down. The
escalade was to be a surprise—the division was to cross the Rivillas at
a point far below the inundation, where the ruins of a mill spanned the
stream, and was to drag ladders up the steep mound to the foot of the
wall.</p>

<p>Two demonstrations, or false attacks, were to be made with the
intention of distracting the enemy—one by Power’s Portuguese brigade
beyond the Guadiana, who were to threaten an escalade on the fort
at the bridge-head: the other by the Portuguese of the 5th Division
against the Pardaleras. At the last moment—the order does not appear
in the full draft of the directions for the storm—Leith, commanding
the 5th Division, was told that he might try an escalade, similar to
that allotted to Picton, against the river-bastion of San Vincente,
the extreme north-west point of the defences, and one that had
hitherto been left entirely untouched by the besiegers. For this he
was to employ one of his two British brigades, leaving the other in
reserve.</p>

<p>Every student of the Peninsular War knows the unexpected result of
the storm: the regular assault on the breaches failed with awful loss,
but all the three subsidiary attacks, on San Roque, the Castle, and San
Vincente, succeeded in the most brilliant style, so that Badajoz was
duly taken, but not in the way that Wellington intended.</p>

<p>The reason why the main assault failed was purely and simply that
Phillipon and his garrison put into the defence of the breaches
not only the most devoted courage, but such an accumulation of
ingenious devices as had never before been seen in a siege of that
generation—apparently Phillipon must share<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span> the credit with his commanding engineer,
Lamare, the historian of the siege. The normal precaution of cutting
off the breaches by retrenchments on both sides, and of throwing up
parapets of earth, sandbags, and wool-packs behind them, was the least
part of the work done. What turned out more effective was a series of
mines and explosive barrels planted at the foot of the counterscarp,
and connected with the ramparts by covered trains. This was on the
near side of the ditch, where there was dead ground unsearched by
the besiegers’ artillery. In the bottom of it, and at the foot of
the breaches, had been placed or thrown all manner of large cumbrous
obstacles, carts and barrows turned upside down, several large damaged
boats, some rope entanglements, and piles of broken gabions and
fascines. The slopes of the breaches had been strewn with crowsfeet,
and were covered with beams studded with nails, not fixed, but hung
by ropes from the lip of the breach; in some places harrows, and
doors studded with long spikes, were set upon the slope. At the top
of each breach was a device never forgotten by any observer, the
<i>chevaux de frise</i>, formed of cavalry sword-blades<a id="FNanchor_268"
href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> set in foot-square
beams, and chained down at their ends. For the defence of the three
breaches Phillipon had told off 700 men, composed of the light and
grenadier companies of each of his battalions, plus the four fusilier
companies of the 103rd Line—about 1,200 men in all. A battalion of
the 88th was in the cathedral square behind, as general reserve. The
two Hessian battalions were on the left, holding the Castle, the
lunette of San Roque, and the San Pedro bastion. The three other
French battalions occupied the long range of bastions from San Juan
to San Vincente. As there had been many casualties, the total of the
available men had sunk to about 4,000, and since nearly half of them
were concentrated at or behind the breaches, the guard was rather thin
at other points—especially (as Picton had calculated) at the Castle,
which, though its front was long, was held by only 250 men, mostly
Hessians.</p>

<p>It was a most unfortunate thing that the time of the assault,
originally fixed for 7.30, was put off till 10—and that the
siege-batteries slacked down after dark. For the two hours thus<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> granted to the besieged
were well spent in repairing and strengthening all their devices
for defence. An earlier assault would have found the preparations
incomplete, especially in the matter of the combustibles placed in the
ditch.</p>

<p>It would be useless, in the narrative of the doings of this bloody
night, to make any attempt to vie with those paragraphs of lurid
description which make Napier’s account of the storm of Badajoz perhaps
the most striking section of one of the most eloquent books in the
English language. All that will be here attempted is to give a clear
and concise note of what happened between ten and one o’clock on the
night of April 6, 1812, so far as it is possible to secure a coherent
tale from the diaries and memoirs of a number of eye-witnesses.
Burgoyne and Jones of the Royal Engineers, Dickson the commander of the
Artillery, Grattan and McCarthy from the 3rd Division, Leith Hay of
the 5th, and Kincaid, Simmons, and Harry Smith of the Light Division,
along with many more less well-known authorities, must serve as our
instructors, each for the part of the storm in which he was himself
concerned.</p>

<p>It had been intended, as was said above, that all the columns should
converge simultaneously on their points of attack, and for that reason
the distances between the starting-point of each division and its
objective had been calculated with care. But, as a matter of fact, the
hour of 10 p.m. was not quite accurately kept. On the right Picton’s
division was descried by the French in the Castle as it was lining
the first parallel, and was heavily fired upon at 9.45, whereupon the
general, seeing that his men were discovered, ordered the advance to
begin at once—the 3rd Division was fording the Rivillas under a blaze
of fire from the Castle and the San Pedro bastion before 10 struck
on the cathedral clock. On the other hand, at the western flank, the
officer in charge of the ladder and hay-bag party which was to lead the
5th Division, lost his way along the bank of the Guadiana, while coming
up from the Park to take his place at the head of Leith’s men. The
column had to wait for the ladders, and was more than an hour late in
starting. Only the central attack, on the three breaches, was delivered
with exact punctuality.</p>

<p>It is perhaps best to deal with this unhappy assault first—it<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> was a horrible affair,
and fully two-thirds of the losses that night were incurred in it.
The two divisions, as ordered, came down the ravine to the left of
the Pardaleras hill without being discovered: the line of vision from
the town was in their favour till they were actually on the glacis,
and heavy firing against Picton’s column was heard as they came
forward. The 4th Division was turning to the right, the Light Division
to the left, just as they drew near the ditch, when suddenly they
were descried, and the French, who were well prepared and had long
been waiting for the expected assault, opened on them with musketry
from all the breaches, and with artillery from the unruined flanking
bastions. The storm began as unhappily as it was to end. The advance
of the 4th Division bearing to the right, came on a part of the ditch
into which the inundation had been admitted—not knowing its depth,
nor that the French had made a six-foot cutting at the foot of the
counterscarp. Many men, not waiting for the ladders, sprang down
into the water, thinking it to be a mere puddle. The leading files
nearly all perished—the regimental record of the Welsh Fusiliers shows
twenty men drowned—that of the Portuguese regiment which was behind
the Fusiliers as many as thirty. Finding the ditch impassable here,
the rest of the 4th Division storming-party swerved to the left, and,
getting beyond the inundation, planted their ladders there: some came
down in this way, more by simply taking a fourteen-foot leap on to the
hay-bags, which they duly cast down. At the same moment the advance
of the Light Division descended in a similar fashion into the ditch
farther to the left, towards Santa Maria. Many men were already at
the bottom, the rest crowded on the edge, where the French engineers
fired the series of fougasses, mines, and powder-barrels which had
been laid in the ditch. They worked perfectly, and the result was
appalling—the 500 volunteers who formed the advance of each division
were almost all slain, scorched, or disabled. Every one of the engineer
officers set to guide the column was killed or wounded, and the want
of direction, caused by the absence of any one who knew the topography
of the breaches, had the most serious effect during the rest of the
storm. Of the Light Division officers with the advance only two escaped
unhurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>There was a
horrible check for a minute or two, and then the heads of the main
column of each division reached the edge of the ditch, and began to
leap down, or to make use of those of the ladders which had not been
broken. The gulf below was all ablaze, for the explosions had set
fire to the carts, boats, broken gabions, &amp;c., which the French
had set in the ditch, and they were burning furiously—every man as
he descended was clearly visible to the enemy entrenched on the top
of the breaches. The troops suffered severely as they dribbled over
the edge of the counterscarp, and began to accumulate in the ditch.
From the first there was great confusion—the two divisions got mixed,
because the 4th had been forced to swerve to its left to avoid the
inundation, and so was on ground originally intended for the Light.
Many men mistook an unfinished ravelin in the bottom of the ditch for
the foot of the central breach, and climbed it, only to find themselves
on a mass of earth divided by a wide sunken space from the point
they were aiming at. To get to the foot of the largest breach, that
in the Trinidad bastion, it was necessary to push some way along the
blazing bottom of the ditch, so as to turn and get round the end of
the inundation. The main thrust of the attack, however, went this way,
only part of the Light Division making for the Santa Maria breach,
on which it had been intended that all should concentrate. As to the
central breach in the curtain, it seems that few or none made their
way<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
thither: the disappointment on reaching the top of the ravelin in front
of it, made all who got alive to that point turn right or left, instead
of descending and pushing straight on. Jones records that next morning
there was hardly a single body of an English soldier on the central
breach, while the slopes and foot of each of the two flank breaches
were heaped with hundreds of corpses. This was a misfortune, as the
curtain breach was the easiest of the three, and having been made only
that afternoon was not retrenched like the others.</p>

<p>From ten to twelve the surviving men in the ditch, fed by the
coming up of the rear battalions of each division, and finally by the
reserve, delivered a series of desperate but disorderly attacks<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> on the Trinidad and
Santa Maria breaches. It is said that on no occasion did more than the
equivalent of a company storm at once—each officer as he struggled to
the front with those of his men who stuck to him, tried the breach
opposite him, and was shot down nearer or farther from its foot.
Very few ever arrived at the top, with its <i>chevaux de frise</i> of
sword-blades. The footing among the beams and spikes was uncertain,
and the French fire absolutely deadly—every man was armed with three
muskets. Next morning observers say that they noted only one corpse
impaled on the <i>chevaux de frise</i> of the Trinidad breach, and a few
more under it, as if men had tried to crawl below, and had had their
heads beaten in or blown to pieces. But the lower parts of the ascent
were absolutely carpeted with the dead, lying one on another.</p>

<p>More than two hours were spent in these desperate but vain attempts
to carry the breaches: it is said that as many as forty separate
assaults were made, but all to no effect—the fire concentrated on
the attacked front was too heavy for any man to face. At last the
assaults ceased: the survivors stood—unable to get forward, unwilling
to retreat—vainly answering the volleys of the French on the walls
above them by an ineffective fire of musketry. Just after twelve,
Wellington, who had been waiting on the hill above, receiving from time
to time reports of the progress of the assault, sent down orders for
the recall of the two divisions. They retired, most unwillingly, and
formed up again, in sadly diminished numbers, not far from the glacis.
The only benefit obtained from their dreadful exertions was that the
attention of the French had been concentrated on the breaches for two
hours—and meanwhile (without their knowledge) the game had been settled
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The losses had been frightful—over one man in four of those engaged:
the Light Division had 68 officers and 861 men killed and wounded out
of about 3,000 present: the 4th Division 84 officers and 841 men out of
3,500. The Portuguese battalions which served with them had lost 400
men more—altogether 2,200 of the best troops in Wellington’s army had
fallen—and all to no result.</p>

<p>But while the main stroke failed, each of the subsidiary attacks,
under Picton and Leith, had met with complete success,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span> and despite of the
disaster on the breaches, Badajoz was at Wellington’s mercy by
midnight. The success of either escalade by itself would have been
enough to settle the game.</p>

<p>Picton’s division, as already mentioned, had been detected by the
French as it was filing into the parallel below the Castle: and since
a heavy fire was at once opened on it, there was no use in halting,
and the general gave the order to advance without delay. The men
went forward on a narrow front, having to cross the Rivillas at the
ruined mill where alone it was fordable. This was done under fire, but
with no great loss. The palisade on the other bank of the stream was
broken down by a general rush, and the storming-party found itself
at the foot of the lofty Castle hill. To get the ladders up it was a
most difficult business—the slope was very steep, almost precipitous
in parts, and the ladders were thirty feet long and terribly heavy.
Though no assault had been expected here, and the preparations were
not so elaborate as at the breaches, yet the besieged were not caught
unprepared, and the column, as it climbed the hill, was torn by cannon
shot and thinned by musketry. The French threw fire-balls over the
wall, and other incandescent stuff (<i>carcasses</i>), so there was fair
light by which to see the stormers. Picton was hit in the groin down
by the Rivillas, and the charge of the assault fell to his senior
brigadier, Kempt, and Major Burgoyne of the Engineers. The narrow space
at the foot of the walls being reached, the ladders were reared, one
after the other, toward the south end of the Castle wall. Six being at
last ready in spots close to each other, an attempt was made to mount,
with an officer at the head of each. But the fire was so heavy, that
no man reached the last rungs alive, and the enemy overthrew all the
ladders and broke several of them. One is said to have been pulled
up by main force into the Castle! Meanwhile the besieged cast heavy
stones and broken beams into the mass of men clustering along the foot
of the wall, and slew many. But the 3rd Division was not spent—Kempt’s
brigade had delivered the first rush—Champlemond’s Portuguese headed
the second, when they had climbed the slope—but also to no effect.
Lastly the rear brigade—Campbell’s—came up, and gave a new impetus to
the attack. There was now a very large force, 4,000 men, striving all
along the base<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> of
the wall, on a front of some 200 yards. Wherever footing could be found
ladders were reared, now at considerable distances from each other. The
garrison of the Castle was not large—two Hessian and one French company
and the gunners, under 300 men, and when simultaneous attacks were
delivered at many points, some of them were scantily opposed. Hence it
came that in more places than one men at last scrambled to the crest
of the wall. A private of the 45th is said to have been the first man
whose body fell inside, not outside, the battlements—the second, we are
told, was an ensign (McAlpin) of the 88th, who defended himself for
a moment on the crest before he was shot. The third man to gain the
summit was Colonel Ridge of the 5th Fusiliers, who found a point where
an empty embrasure made the wall a little lower, entered it with two or
three of his men, and held out long enough to allow more ladders to be
planted behind him, and a nucleus to gather in his rear. He pushed on
the moment that fifteen or twenty men had mounted, and the thin line of
defenders being once pierced the resistance suddenly broke down—all the
remaining ladders were planted, and the 3rd Division began to stream
into the Castle. Picton was by this time again in command; he had
recovered his strength, and had hobbled up the slope, relieving Kempt,
who was by now also wounded. The time was about eleven o’clock, and
the din at the breaches down below showed that they were still being
defended.</p>

<p>It took some time to dislodge the remainder of the garrison from the
Castle precinct; many took refuge in the keep, and defended it from
stair to stair, till they were exterminated. But by 12 midnight all
was over, and Picton would have debouched from the Castle, to sweep
the ramparts, but for the fact that all its gates, save one postern,
were found to have been bricked up—the French having intended to make
it their last point of resistance if the town should fall. The one
free postern being at last found, the division was preparing to break
out, when the head of its column was attacked by the French general
reserve, a battalion of the 88th, which Phillipon had sent up from the
cathedral square, when he heard that the Castle had been forced. There
was a sharp fight before the French were driven off, in which (most
unhappily) Ridge, the hero of the escalade, was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span> shot dead. By the time that this was
over, Badajoz had been entered at another point, and Picton’s success
was only part of the decisive stroke. But as he had captured in the
Castle all the French ammunition reserve, and nearly all their food,
the town must anyhow have fallen, because of his daring exploit. The
loss of the division was not excessive considering the difficulties
they had overcome, about 500 British and 200 Portuguese out of 4,000
men engaged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the valley below the Castle, the guards of the
trenches had stormed the lunette of San Roque, and were hard at work
cutting the dam, so that in an hour or two the inundation was beginning
to drain off rapidly. This also would have been a decisive success, if
nothing else had been accomplished elsewhere.</p>

<p>The blow, however, which actually finished the business, and
caused the French to fail at the breaches, was delivered by quite
another force. It will be remembered that a brigade—Walker’s—of the
5th Division, had been directed to escalade the remote river-bastion
of San Vincente. It was nearly an hour late, because of the tiresome
mistake made by the officer charged with the bringing up of the
ladders from the Park. And only at a few minutes past eleven did
Leith, heading the column, arrive before the palisades of the covered
way, near the Guadiana. Walker’s men were detected on the glacis, and
a heavy artillery fire was opened on them from San Vincente and San
José, but they threw down many of the palisades and began to descend
into the ditch—a drop of 12 feet. There was a cut in the bottom, to
which water from the Guadiana had been let in, and the wall in front
was 30 feet high. Hence the first attempts to plant the ladders were
unavailing, and many men fell. But coasting around the extreme north
end of the bastion, close to the river, some officers found that the
flank sloped down to a height of only 20 feet, where the bastion joined
the waterside wall. Three or four ladders were successfully planted
here, while the main attention of the garrison was distracted to the
frontal attack, and a stream of men of the 4th, 30th, and 44th began
to pour up them. The French broke before the flank attack: they were
not numerous, for several companies had been drawn off to help at the
breaches, and the bastion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p.
254]</span> won. As soon as a few hundred men were formed, General
Walker led them along the ramparts, and carried the second bastion,
that of San José. But the two French battalions holding the succeeding
western bastions now massed together, and made a firm resistance in
that of Santiago. The stormers were stopped, and an unhappy incident
broke their impetus—some lighted port-fires thrown down by the French
artillerymen were lying about—some one called out that they were the
matches of mines. Thereupon the advancing column instinctively fell
back some paces—the French charged and drove them in, and the whole
retired fighting confusedly as far as San Vincente. Here General Leith
had fortunately left a reserve battalion, the 2/38th, which, though
only 230 strong, stopped the panic and broke the French advance.
Walker’s brigade rallied and advanced again—though its commander was
desperately wounded—and once more the enemy were swept all along the
western bastions, which they lost one by one.</p>

<p>Some of the 5th Division descended into the streets of the town, and
pushing for the rear of the great breaches, by a long détour through
the silent streets, at last came in upon them, and opened a lively fire
upon the backs of the enemy who were manning the retrenchments. The
main body, however, driving before them the garrison of the southern
bastions, hurtled in upon the flank of the Santa Maria. At this moment
the 4th and Light Divisions, by Wellington’s orders, advanced again
towards the ditch, where their dead or disabled comrades were lying so
thick. They thought that they were going to certain death, not being
aware of what had happened inside the city. But as they descended into
the ditch only a few scattering shots greeted them. The French main
body—for 2,000 men had been driven in together behind the breaches—had
just thrown down their arms and surrendered to the 5th Division. Even
when there was no resistance, the breaches proved hard to mount, and
the obstructions at the top were by no means easy to remove.</p>

<p>The governor, Phillipon, had escaped into San Cristobal with a few
hundred men, and surrendered there at dawn, having no food and little
ammunition. But he first sent out the few horsemen of the garrison to
run the gauntlet of the Portuguese pickets, and bear the evil news to
Soult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span>Thus fell
Badajoz: the best summary of its fall is perhaps that of Leith Hay,
who followed his relative, the commander of the 5th Division, in the
assault on San Vincente:—</p>

<p>‘Had Lord Wellington relied on the storming of the breaches alone,
the town would not have been taken. Had General Leith received his
ladders punctually and escaladed at 10, as intended, he would have been
equally successful, and the unfortunate divisions at the breaches would
have been saved an hour of dreadful loss. If Leith had failed, Badajoz
would still have fallen, in consequence of the 3rd Division carrying
the Castle—but not till the following morning; and the enemy might have
given further trouble. Had Picton failed, still the success of the 5th
Division ensured the fall of the place.’ The moral would seem to be
that precautions cannot be too numerous—it was the afterthoughts in
this case, and not the main design, that were successful and saved the
game.</p>

<p>Wellington himself, in a document—a letter to Lord Liverpool—that
long escaped notice, and did not get printed in its right place
in the ninth volume of his <i>Dispatches</i><a id="FNanchor_270"
href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>, made a commentary on
the perilous nature of the struggle and the greatness of the losses
which must not be suppressed. He ascribed them to deficiencies in the
engineering department. ‘The capture of Badajoz affords as strong an
instance of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed.
But I greatly hope that I shall never again be the instrument of
putting them to such a test as they were put to last night. I assure
your lordship that it is quite impossible to carry fortified places
by <i>vive force</i> without incurring grave loss and being exposed to the
chance of failure, unless the army should be provided with a sufficient
trained corps of sappers and miners.... The consequences of being so
unprovided with the people necessary to approach a regularly fortified
place are, first, that our engineers, though well-educated and brave,
have never turned their minds to the mode of conducting a regular
siege, as it is useless to think of that which, in our service, it is
impossible to perform. They think that they have done their duty when
they have constructed a battery, with a secure<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span> communication to it, which can breach the
place. Secondly, these breaches have to be carried by <i>vive force</i> at
an infinite sacrifice of officers and soldiers.... These great losses
could be avoided, and, in my opinion, time gained in every siege, if
we had properly trained people to carry it on. I declare that I have
never seen breaches more practicable in themselves than the three in
the walls of Badajoz, and the fortress must have surrendered with these
breaches open, if I had been able to “approach” the place. But when I
had made the third breach, on the evening of the 6th, I could do no
more. I was then obliged either to storm or to give the business up;
and when I ordered the assault I was certain that I should lose our
best officers and men. It is a cruel situation for any person to be
placed in, and I earnestly request your lordship to have a corps of
sappers and miners formed without loss of time.’</p>

<p>The extraordinary fact that no trained corps of sappers and miners
existed at this time was the fault neither of Wellington nor of the
Liverpool ministry, but of the professional advisers of the cabinets
that had borne office ever since the great French War broke out. The
need had been as obvious during the sieges of 1793-4 in Flanders as in
1812. That the Liverpool ministry could see the point, and wished to
do their duty, was shown by the fact that they at once proceeded to
turn six companies of the existing corps of ‘Royal Military Artificers’
into sappers. On April 23, less than three weeks after Badajoz fell,
a warrant was issued for instructing the whole corps in military
field-works. On August 4 their name was changed from ‘Royal Military
Artificers’ to ‘Royal Sappers and Miners.’ The transformation was
much too late for the siege of Burgos, but by 1813 the companies were
beginning to join the Peninsular Army, and at San Sebastian they were
well to the front. An end was at last made to the system hitherto
prevailing, by which the troops which should have formed the rank and
file of the Royal Engineers were treated as skilled mechanics, mainly
valuable for building and carpentering work at home stations.</p>

<p class="mt1">One more section, a most shameful one, must be added to
the narrative of the fall of Badajoz. We have already had to tell of
the grave disorders which two months before had followed the storm of
Ciudad Rodrigo. These were but trifling and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> venial compared with the offences which
were committed by the men who had just gone through the terrible
experiences of the night of April 6th. At Rodrigo there was much
drunkenness, a good deal of plunder, and some wanton fire-raising:
many houses had been sacked, a few inhabitants were maltreated, but
none, it is believed, were mortally hurt. At Badajoz the outrages of
all kinds passed belief; the looting was general and systematic, and
rape and bloodshed were deplorably common. Explanatory excuses have
been made, to the effect that the army had an old grudge against the
inhabitants of the city, dating back to the time when several divisions
were quartered in and about it, after Talavera. It was also said that
all the patriotic inhabitants had fled long ago, and that those who had
remained behind were mainly <i>Afrancesados</i>, traitors to the general
cause. There was some measure of truth in both allegations: it was no
doubt true that there had been quarrels in 1809, and that many loyalist
families had evacuated the city after the French occupation, and had
transferred themselves to other parts of Estremadura. The population
at the time of the British storm was not two-thirds of the normal
figure. But these excuses will not serve. There can be no doubt that
the outrages were in no sense reasoned acts of retribution, but were a
simple outburst of ruffianism.</p>

<p>Old military tradition in all the armies of Europe held that a
garrison which refused to surrender when the breaches had become
practicable was at the mercy of the conqueror for life and limb,
and that a town resisting to extremity was the natural booty of the
stormers. In the eighteenth century there were countless instances
of a fortress, defended with courage up to the moment when an
assault was possible, surrendering on the express plea that the
lives of the garrison were forfeit if it held out, when resistance
could no longer be successful. The attacking party held that all
the lives which it lost after the place had become untenable were
lost unnecessarily, because of the unreasonable obstinacy of the
besieged: the latter therefore could expect no quarter. This was not
an unnatural view when the circumstances are considered. The defender
of a wall or a breach has an immense advantage over the stormer,
till the moment when the latter has succeeded in closing, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span> in bringing his superior
numbers to bear. In a curious hortatory address which Phillipon
published to his garrison<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271"
class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, the passage occurs, ‘realize thoroughly
that a man mounting up a ladder cannot use his weapon unless he is
left unmolested: the head comes up above the parapet unprotected, and
a wary soldier can destroy in succession as many enemies as appear
at the ladder-top.’ This is perfectly true: but Phillipon naturally
avoided stating the logical conclusion, viz. that when the stormers
finally succeed in crowning the ramparts, they will be particularly
ill-disposed towards the garrison who have, till the last moment,
been braining their comrades or shooting them through the head at
small risk to themselves. When the assailant, after seeing several
of his predecessors on the ladder deliberately butchered by a man
under cover, gets by some special piece of luck on a level with his
adversary, it will be useless for the latter to demand quarter. If
it is a question of showing mercy, why did not the other side begin?
<i>Que messieurs les assassins commencent</i>, as the French humorist
remarked to the humanitarian, who protested against capital punishment
for murderers. There is a grim story of a party of Tuscan soldiers
of the 113th Line, who were pinned into a ravelin on the flank of
the lesser breach at Rodrigo, and after firing to the last minute
upon the flank of the Light Division, threw down their arms, when
they saw themselves cut off, calling out that they were ‘<i>poveros
Italianos</i>’—’So you’re not French but <i>Italians</i> are you—then
here’s a shot for you,’ was the natural answer<a id="FNanchor_272"
href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>:—reflections as to the
absence of any national enmity towards the victors should have occurred
to the vanquished before, and not after, the breach was carried. The
same thing happened at the Castle of Badajoz to the companies, mainly
Hessians, who so long held down the stormers of the 3rd Division. If
the defenders of the breaches escaped summary massacre, it was because
the breaches were not carried by force, and the main body of the French
surrendered some time after the assault had ceased, and to troops of
the 5th Division, who had not been personally engaged with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span>It was
universally held in all armies during the wars of the early nineteenth
century that the garrison which resisted to the last moment, after
success had become impossible, had no rights. Ney wrote to the governor
of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1810, ‘further resistance will force the Prince
of Essling to treat you with all the rigour of the laws of war. You
have to choose between honourable capitulation and the terrible
vengeance of a victorious army<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273"
class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.’ Suchet, in more brutal words, told the
governor of Tortosa that he should put to the sword a garrison which
resisted instead of capitulating ‘when the laws of war make it his
duty to do so, large breaches being opened and the walls ruined<a
id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.’ A
very clear statement of this sanguinary theory is found in a passage in
the Memoirs of Contreras, the unlucky governor of Tarragona in 1811<a
id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.
‘The day after the storm General Suchet had me brought before him on
a stretcher [he was severely wounded] and in presence of his chief
officers and of my own, told me in a loud voice that I was the cause of
all the horrors which his troops had committed in Tarragona, because
I had held out beyond the limit prescribed in the laws of war, and
that those laws directed him to have me executed, for not capitulating
when the breach was opened; that having taken the place by assault he
had the right to slay and burn <i>ad infinitum</i>.’ I replied that ‘if
it is true that the laws of war state that, if the besieger gets in,
he may deliver to the sword and the flames town and garrison, and
if they therefore suggest as a proper moment for capitulation that
when an assault has become practicable, it is nevertheless true that
they do not prohibit the besieged from resisting the assault, if he
considers that he can beat it off: I had sufficient forces to hold my
own, and should have done so if my orders had been properly carried
out. Therefore I should have been called a coward if I had not tried
to resist, and no law prohibited me from repulsing an assault if I
could.’</p>

<p>But, as has been pointed out recently<a id="FNanchor_276"
href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, Wellington himself
may be quoted in favour of this theory. In a letter written to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span> Canning in 1820
concerning quite another matter, he remarked, ‘I believe that it has
always been understood that the defenders of a fortress stormed have
no claim to quarter, and the practice which prevailed during the last
century of surrendering fortresses when a breach was opened, and the
counterscarp blown in, was founded on this understanding. Of late years
the French availed themselves of the humanity of modern warfare, and
made a new regulation that a breach should stand one assault at least.
The consequence of this regulation of Bonaparte’s was the loss to me of
the flower of my army, in the assaults on Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. I
should have thought myself justified in putting both garrisons to the
sword, and if I had done so at the first, it is probable that I should
have saved 5,000 men at the second. I mention this to show you that the
practice which refuses quarter to a garrison that stands an assault is
not a <i>useless</i> effusion of blood.’</p>

<p>Comparatively few of the garrisons of Rodrigo and Badajoz were shot
down, and those all in hot blood in the moment after the walls were
carried. Suchet’s army was much more pitiless at Tarragona, where a
great part of the Spanish garrison was deliberately hunted down and
slaughtered. But there was, of course, a much more bitter feeling
between French and Spaniards than between English and French.</p>

<p>The only reason for enlarging on this deplorable theme is that
there was a close connexion in the minds of all soldiers of the
early nineteenth century, from the highest to the lowest ranks,
between the idea that an over-obstinate garrison had forfeited
quarter, and the idea that the town they had defended was liable
to sack. This may be found plainly stated in Lannes’s summons
to Palafox at Saragossa in January 1809<a id="FNanchor_277"
href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>, in the
capitulation-debate before the surrender of Badajoz in 1811, in
Augereau’s address to the inhabitants of Gerona<a id="FNanchor_278"
href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>, in Leval’s summons
to the governor of Tarifa<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"
class="fnanchor">[279]</a>, and with special emphasis in Suchet’s
threatening epistle to Blake on the day before the fall of Valencia:
‘in a few hours a general assault will precipitate into your city
the French columns: if you delay till this terrible moment, it
will not be in my power to restrain the fury<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span> of the soldiery, and you alone will be
responsible before God and man for the evils which will overwhelm
Valencia. It is the desire to avert the complete destruction of a great
town that determines me to offer you honourable terms of capitulation<a
id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>.’
It was hardly necessary in the Napoleonic era to enlarge on the
connexion between storm and sack—it was presupposed. Every governor who
capitulated used to put in his report to his own government a mention
of his ‘desire to spare the unfortunate inhabitants the horrors of a
storm.’</p>

<p>This idea, sad to say, was as deeply rooted in the minds of
British as of French soldiers. It is frankly confessed in many a
Peninsular diary. ‘The men were permitted to enjoy themselves (!)
for the remainder of the day,’ says Kincaid in his narrative of
the fall of Badajoz, ‘and the usual frightful scene of plunder
commenced, which officers thought it prudent to avoid for the moment
by retiring to the camp<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281"
class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.’ ‘The troops were, of course, admitted to
the immemorial privilege of tearing the town to pieces,’ says another
writer on another occasion<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282"
class="fnanchor">[282]</a>. The man in the ranks regarded the connexion
of storm and sack as so close that he could write, ‘the prisoners being
secured and the gates opened, we were allowed to enter the town <i>for
the purpose of plundering it</i><a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283"
class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.’ But perhaps the most eye-opening sentence
on the subject is Wellington’s official order of April 7, 1812,
issued late in the day, and when the sack had already been going on
for fifteen or eighteen hours, ‘It is now full time that the plunder
of Badajoz should cease; an officer and six steady non-commissioned
officers will be sent from each regiment, British and Portuguese,
of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and Light Divisions into the town, at 5 a.m.
to-morrow morning, to bring away any men still straggling there<a
id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.’</p>

<p>It was unfortunately the fact that Badajoz was a Spanish and not a
French town, and this adds a special shame to the lamentable outrages
which were perpetrated in its streets for many hours after the storm.
It is comparatively seldom in war that an army takes by assault a
town which does not belong to the hostile power. The only parallel of
recent years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span> to the
sack of Badajoz had been that of Lübeck in November 1806. Blücher’s
Prussian corps, retiring before the pursuing French, trespassed on
neutral territory by seizing on the old Hanseatic city, which lay in
its way, and endeavouring to defend it. The magistrates protested,
but were powerless, as they had no armed force at their disposition.
Then the French came upon the scene, and, after a fierce fight, won
their way over wall and ditch and took the place. They sacked it from
end to end with every circumstance of atrocity<a id="FNanchor_285"
href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>: Marshal Bernadotte,
when importuned by the Burgomaster to stay the horrors, said that he
was sorry, but that his troops only recognized the fact that they were
in a stormed town—he and his officers could only succeed in calling
them off after the city had been half destroyed. This was sufficiently
horrible; but to sack a town belonging to a friendly nation is a shade
worse than to sack a neutral place—and this the British troops did.</p>

<p>Two short quotations from eye-witnesses may serve to show the kind
of scenes that prevailed in Badajoz from the early hours of the morning
on April 7th down to the following night.</p>

<p>‘Unfortunate Badajoz,’ writes one narrator<a id="FNanchor_286"
href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>, ‘met with the usual
fate of places taken at the point of the bayonet. In less than an
hour after it fell into our possession it looked as if centuries had
gradually completed its destruction. The surviving soldier, after
storming a town, considers it as his indisputable property, and thinks
himself at liberty to commit any enormity by way of indemnifying
himself for the risking of his life. The bloody strife has made him
insensible to every better feeling: his lips are parched by the
extraordinary exertions that he has made, and from necessity, as well
as inclination, his first search is for liquor. This once obtained,
every trace of human nature vanishes, and no brutal outrage can be
named which he does not commit. The town was not only plundered of
every article that could be carried off, but whatever was useless or
too heavy to move was wantonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p.
263]</span> destroyed. Whenever an officer appeared in the streets
the wretched inhabitants flocked round him with terror and despair,
embraced his knees and supplicated his protection. But it was vain
to oppose the soldiers: there were 10,000 of them crowding the
streets, the greater part drunk and discharging their pieces in all
directions—it was difficult to escape them unhurt. A couple of hundred
of their women from the camp poured also into the place, when it
was barely taken, to have their share of the plunder. They were, if
possible, worse than the men. Gracious God! such tigresses in the
shape of women! I sickened when I saw them coolly step over the dying,
indifferent to their cries for a drop of water, and deliberately search
the pockets of the dead for money, or even divest them of their bloody
coats. But no more of these scenes of horror. I went deliberately
into the town to harden myself to the sight of human misery—and I
have had enough of it: my blood has been frozen with the outrages I
witnessed.’</p>

<p>Another eye-witness gives a passing glimpse of horrors. ‘Duty being
over, I chanced to meet my servant, who seemed to have his haversack
already well filled with plunder. I asked him where the regiment was:
he answered that he did not know, but that he had better conduct me
to the camp, as I appeared to be wounded. I certainly was hit in the
head, but in the excitement of the escalade had not minded it, nor had
I felt a slight wound in my leg: but, as I began to be rather weak, I
took his advice, and he assisted me on. In passing what appeared to
be a religious house I saw two soldiers dragging out an unfortunate
nun, her clothes all torn: in her agony she knelt and held up a
cross. Remorse seized one of the men, who appeared more sober than
the other, and he swore she should not be outraged. The other soldier
drew back a step and shot his comrade dead. At this moment we found
ourselves surrounded by several Portuguese: they ordered us to halt,
and presented their muskets at us. I said to my servant, “throw them
some of your plunder:” he instantly took off his haversack and threw it
among them: some dollars and other silver coin rolled out. They then
let us pass—had he not done so they would have shot us—as they did
several others. We got safe to the bastion, and my servant carried me
on his back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span>
camp, where I got a draught of water, fell asleep instantly, and did
not waken till after midday<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287"
class="fnanchor">[287]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘In justice to the army’—we quote from another authority<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>—’I
must say that the outrages were not general: in many cases they were
perpetrated by cold-blooded villains who had been backward enough in
the attack. Many risked their lives in defending helpless women, and,
though it was rather a dangerous moment for an officer to interfere,
I saw many of them running as much risk to prevent inhumanity as they
did in the preceding night while storming the town.’ The best-known
incident of the kind is the story of Harry Smith of the 95th, who saved
a young Spanish lady in the tumult, and married her two days later,
in the presence of the Commander-in-Chief himself, who gave away the
bride. This hastily-wedded spouse, Juana de Leon, was the Lady Smith
who was the faithful companion of her husband through so many campaigns
in Spain, Belgium, and South Africa, and gave her name to the town in
Natal which, nearly ninety years after the siege of Badajoz, was to be
the scene of the sternest leaguer that British troops have endured in
our own generation. Harry Smith’s narrative of the Odyssey of himself
and his young wife in 1812-14, as told in his autobiography, is one of
the most romantic tales of love and war that have ever been set down on
paper.</p>

<p>It was not till late in the afternoon of the 7th that Wellington, as
has been already mentioned, came to the rather tardy conclusion that
‘it was now full time that the plunder of Badajoz should cease.’ He
sent in Power’s Portuguese brigade to clear out those of the plunderers
who had not already gone back exhausted to their camps, and erected
a gallows in the cathedral square, for the hanging of any criminals
who might be detected lingering on for further outrages. Authorities
differ as to whether the Provost Marshal did, or did not, put his
power in action: the balance of evidence seems to show that the mere
threat sufficed to bring the sack to an end. The men were completely
exhausted: Napier remarks that ‘the tumult rather subsided than was
quelled.’</p>

  <p class="subh3">OPERATIONS OF THE FRENCH DURING THE&nbsp;SIEGE OF&nbsp;BADAJOZ</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> proceeding to demonstrate the
wide-spreading results of the fall of the great Estremaduran fortress,
it is necessary to follow the movements of the French armies which had
been responsible for its safety.</p>

<p>Soult had been before Cadiz when, on March 11, he received news
from Drouet that troops were arriving at Elvas from the North, and on
March 20 the more definite information that Wellington had moved out
in force on the 14th, and invested Badajoz on the 16th. The Marshal’s
long absence from his head-quarters at Seville at this moment, when he
had every reason to suspect that the enemy’s next stroke would be in
his own direction, is curious. Apparently his comparative freedom from
anxiety had two causes. The first was his confidence that Badajoz, with
its excellent governor and its picked garrison, could be relied upon to
make a very long defence. The second was that he was fully persuaded
that when the time of danger arrived he could count on Marmont’s
help—as he had in June 1811. On February 7 he wrote to his colleague<a
id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
that he had just heard of the fall of Rodrigo, that Wellington’s next
movement would naturally be against Badajoz, and that he was glad to
learn that Montbrun’s divisions, on their return from Alicante, were
being placed in the valley of the Tagus. ‘I see with pleasure that your
excellency has given him orders to get in touch with the Army of the
South. As long as this communication shall exist, the enemy will not
dare to make a push against Badajoz, because at his first movement we
can join our forces and march against him for a battle. I hope that it
may enter into your plans to leave a corps between the Tagus and the
Guadiana, the Truxillo road, and the Sierra de Guadalupe, where it can
feed, and keep in touch with the troops which I keep in the Serena [the
district about Medellin, Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p.
266]</span> Benito, and Zalamea, where Daricau was cantoned]. I am
persuaded that, when the campaigning season begins, the enemy will
do all he can to seize Badajoz, because he dare attempt nothing in
Castille so long as that place offers us a base from which to invade
Portugal and fall upon his line of communications.... I am bound,
therefore, to make a pressing demand that your left wing may be kept
in a position which makes the communication between our armies sure,
so that we may be able, by uniting our disposable forces, to go out
against the enemy with the assurance of success.’</p>

<p>This was precisely what Marmont had intended to do. He was
convinced, like Soult, that Wellington’s next move would be against
Badajoz, and he placed Montbrun and the divisions of Foy, Brennier,
and Sarrut about Talavera, Monbeltran, and Almaraz, precisely in
order that they might be in easy touch with Drouet. On February 22
he wrote to his colleague explaining his purpose in so doing, and
his complete acquiescence in the plan for a joint movement against
Wellington, whenever the latter should appear on the Guadiana<a
id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>.
His pledge was quite honest and genuine, and in reliance on it Soult
made all his arrangements. These, however, appear to have been rather
loose and careless: the Marshal seems to have felt such complete
confidence in the combination that he made insufficient preparations
on his own side. No reinforcements were sent either to Badajoz or
to Drouet, whose 12,000 men were dispersed in a very long front in
Estremadura, reaching from Medellin and Don Benito on the right to
Fregenal on the left. This is why Graham, when he moved forward briskly
on March 17th, found no solid body of the enemy in front of him, but
only scattered brigades and regiments, which made off in haste, and
which only succeeded at last in concentrating so far to the rear as
Fuente Ovejuna, which is actually in Andalusia, and behind the crest
of the Sierra Morena. We may add that having been advised by Drouet
as early as March 11th<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291"
class="fnanchor">[291]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p.
267]</span> that British troops were accumulating behind Elvas,
Soult ought to have taken the alarm at once, to have moved back to
Seville from Santa Maria by Cadiz, where he lay on that date, and
to have issued orders for the concentration of his reserves. He did
none of these things, was still in front of Cadiz on March 20<a
id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>, and
did not prescribe any movement of troops till, on that day, he received
Drouet’s more definite and alarming news that Wellington was in person
at Elvas, and had moved out toward Badajoz on the 16th. Clearly he
lost nine days by want of sufficient promptness, and had but himself
to blame if he could only start from Seville with a considerable
field-force on March 30. All that he appears to have done on March 11
was to write to Marmont that the long-foreseen hypothesis of a move of
Wellington on Badajoz was being verified, and that they must prepare to
unite their forces. Jourdan has, therefore, some justification for his
remark that he does not see why Soult should have been before Cadiz,
amusing himself by throwing shells into that place<a id="FNanchor_293"
href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> as late as March
20th.</p>

<p>From the 20th to the 30th of that month Soult was busily engaged
in organizing the relief-column which, after picking up Drouet on the
way, was to march to the succour of Badajoz. He could not venture
to touch the divisions of Conroux and Cassagne, which together were
none too strong to provide for the manning of the Cadiz Lines and the
fending off of Ballasteros from their rear. But he called off the
whole division of Barrois, nearly 8,000 strong<a id="FNanchor_294"
href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>, Vichery’s brigade
of infantry from Leval’s division in the province of Granada<a
id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>, and
six regiments of Digeon’s and Pierre Soult’s dragoons. This, with the
corresponding artillery, made a column of some 13,000 men, with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> which the Marshal started
from Seville on the 30th March, crossed the Guadalquivir at Lora del
Rio next day, and moved on Constantina and Guadalcanal. An interesting
complication would have been caused if Graham had been allowed to
stop with his 19,000 men at Azuaga and Llerena, where he was directly
between Soult and Drouet’s position at Fuente Ovejuna, and if Hill
from Merida had moved against Drouet’s corps. But as Wellington had
withdrawn Graham’s column to Villafranca on March 31, there was nothing
left to prevent Drouet from coming in from his excentric position, and
joining his chief at Llerena on April 4th, with the 12,000 men of his
own and Daricau’s divisions. This gave the Marshal some 25,000 men<a
id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
in hand, a force which would be manifestly incapable of raising the
siege of Badajoz, for he knew that Wellington had at least 45,000 men
in hand, and, as a matter of fact, the arrival of the 5th Division
and other late detachments had raised the Anglo-Portuguese army to
something more like 55,000 sabres and bayonets.</p>

<p>Wellington’s orders, when he heard that Soult was in the passes,
and that Drouet was moving to join him, directed Graham to fall back
on the Albuera position, and Hill to join him there by the route of
Lobon and Talavera Real, if it should appear that all the French
columns were moving directly to the relief of Badajoz, and none of them
spreading out eastward towards the Upper Guadiana<a id="FNanchor_297"
href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. These conditions were
realized,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span> as Soult
moved in one solid body towards Villafranca and Fuente del Maestre:
so Hill evacuated Merida, after destroying its bridge, and joined
Graham on the old Albuera ground on April 6th. They had 31,000 men,
including four British divisions and four British cavalry brigades, and
Wellington could have reinforced them from the lines before Badajoz
with two divisions more, if it had been necessary, while still leaving
the fortress adequately blockaded by 10,000 or 12,000 men. But as Soult
did not appear at Fuente del Maestre and Villafranca till the afternoon
of April 7th, a day after Badajoz had fallen, this need did not arise.
The Marshal, learning of the disaster, hastily turned back and retired
towards Andalusia, wisely observing that he ‘could not fight the
whole English army.’ It is interesting to speculate what would have
happened if he had lingered five days less before Cadiz, had issued his
concentration orders on the 14th or 15th instead of the 20th March, and
had appeared at Villafranca on the 2nd instead of the 7th of the next
month. His dispatch of April 17 states that he had intended to fight,
despite of odds, to save Badajoz: if he had done so, and had attacked
40,000 Anglo-Portuguese with his 25,000 men, he must inevitably have
suffered a dreadful disaster. He must have fought a second battle of
Albuera with much the same strength that he had at the first, while his
enemy would have had six British divisions instead of two, and an equal
instead of a wholly inferior cavalry. The result of such a battle could
hardly have failed to be not only a crushing defeat for the French, but
the prompt loss of all Andalusia; for thrown back on that kingdom with
a routed army, and unable to gather in promptly reserves scattered over
the whole land, from the Cadiz Lines to Granada and Malaga, he must
have evacuated his viceroyalty, and have retreated in haste either on
La Mancha or on Valencia.</p>

<p>It is most improbable, however, that Soult would really have
ventured to attack the Albuera position<a id="FNanchor_298"
href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>, in spite of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span> confident language of
his ex-post-facto dispatches. His whole plan of operations depended
on his being joined by the Army of Portugal, in accordance with
Marmont’s promise of February 22nd. And he was well aware, by a letter
sent by Foy to Drouet on March 31st, and received on April 6th, that
he could expect no help from the North for many weeks, if any came
at all. That Badajoz was never relieved was due, not to Soult’s
delay in concentrating (though this was no doubt unwise), nor to his
over-confidence in Phillipon’s power of resistance, which was (as it
turned out) misplaced. He wrote to Berthier that ‘the garrison wanted
for nothing—it had still food for two months, and was abundantly
provided with munitions: its total strength was 5,000 men: it had
victoriously repulsed three assaults: the men were convinced that,
however great a hostile force presented itself before the breaches,
it would never carry them: Phillipon had been informed on March 28th
that I was marching to his help: the troops were in enthusiastic
spirits, though they had already lost 500 men in successful sorties: my
advanced guard was at only one long day’s march from the place, when it
succumbs!’ It was indeed an <i>évènement funeste</i>!</p>

<p>But Soult’s late arrival and miscalculation of the time that the
siege would take, were neither of them the causes of the fall of
Badajoz. It would have fallen none the less if he had arrived on the
Albuera upon April 2nd. The fate of the place was really settled
by Napoleon’s dispatches to Marmont, with which we dealt at great
length in an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299"
class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. The orders of February 11 and February
21 (received by the Duke of Ragusa on February 26 and March 2
respectively) forbade him to worry about Badajoz, ‘a very strong
fortress supported by an army of 80,000 men,’ and told him to withdraw
to Salamanca two of the three divisions which he was keeping in the
valley of the Tagus, and to reply to any movement of Wellington into
Estremadura by invading Northern Portugal. The plan which Soult and
Marmont had concerted for a joint relief of Badajoz was expressly
forbidden by their master, on his erroneous hypothesis that a thrust
at Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida must bring Wellington home again.
Marmont’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span> promise
of co-operation, sent off on February 22nd to Seville, was rendered
impossible—through no fault of his—by the imperial dispatch received
four days later, which expressly forbade him to stand by it. ‘The
English will only go southward if you, by your ill-devised scheme, keep
two or three divisions detached on the Tagus: that reassures them,
and tells them that you have no offensive projects against them.’ So
Marmont, protesting and prophesying future disaster, was compelled to
withdraw two divisions from the central position on the Tagus, and to
leave there only Foy’s 5,000 men—a negligible quantity in the problem.
Nor was this all—he was not even allowed to send them back, since the
whole Army of Portugal was ordered to march into the Beira.</p>

<p>Soult, therefore, was justified in his wrath when he wrote to
Marmont that he had been given a promise and that it had been broken,
‘if there had been the least attempt to concert operations between the
armies of Portugal and the South, the English army would have been
destroyed, and Badajoz would still be in the power of the Emperor. I
deplore bitterly the fact that you have not been able to come to an
arrangement with me on the subject.’ But the wrath should have been
directed against the Emperor, not against his lieutenant, who had
so unwillingly been forced to break his promise. The only censure,
perhaps, that can be laid upon Marmont is that he should have made it
more clear to Soult that, by the new directions from Paris, he was
rendered unable to redeem his pledge. Soult was not, however, without
warnings that something of the kind might happen: Berthier had written
to him on February 11th, and the letter must have arrived by the middle
of March, that the Emperor was displeased to find him appealing for
troops of the Army of Portugal to be moved to Truxillo, and that he
ought to be more dependent on his own strength<a id="FNanchor_300"
href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. It would have been
better if the Emperor’s trusty scribe had explained to Soult that
Marmont was expressly forbidden, in a dispatch written that same day,
to keep more than one division on the Tagus, or to worry himself about
the danger of Badajoz.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p.
272]</span></p> <p>Marmont’s original plan for joining Soult via
Almaraz might have failed—he himself confesses it in one of his replies
to Berthier. But it was the only scheme which presented any prospect
of success. By making it impossible Napoleon rendered the fall of
Badajoz certain. For it is no defence whatever to point out that his
dispatch of March 12th, which reached Salamanca on March 27, finally
gave Marmont the option of going southward. By that time it was too
late to try the move:—if the Duke of Ragusa had marched for Almaraz and
Truxillo next morning, he would still have been many days too late to
join Soult before April 6th, the date on which Badajoz fell.</p>

<p>Summing up the whole operation, we must conclude that Wellington’s
plan, which depended for its efficacy on the slowness with which the
French always received information, and the difficulty which they
always experienced in concentrating and feeding large bodies of troops
in winter or early spring, was bound to be successful, unless an
improbable conjunction of chances had occurred. If Marmont and Soult
had both taken the alarm at the earliest possible moment, and had
each marched with the strongest possible field army, Soult with the
25,000 men that he actually collected, Marmont with the three divisions
that lay on the Tagus on March 1st, and three more from Castile<a
id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>,
they might have met east of Merida somewhere about the last days of
March. In that case their united strength would have been from 50,000
to 55,000 men: Wellington had as many, so that he would not have been
bound down to the mere defensive policy that he took up on the Caya
in June-July 1811, when his numbers were decidedly less than now. But
the chance that both Marmont and Soult would do the right thing in
the shortest possible time was unlikely. They would have had terrible
difficulties from the torrential rains that prevailed in the last ten
days of March, and the consequent badness of the roads. Marmont’s (if
not Soult’s) food-problem would have been a hard one, as he himself
shows in several of his letters. Soult got his first definite alarm
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span> March 11th:
Marmont could hardly move till he had learnt that Wellington had
started for Estremadura in person: till this was certain, he could
not be sure that the main body of the Anglo-Portuguese army was not
still behind the Agueda. Wellington only left Freneda on March 5th,
and Marmont did not know of his departure till some days later. If
the two marshals had each issued prompt concentration orders on
March 11, it still remains very doubtful if they would have met in
time to foil Wellington’s object. As a matter of fact Soult (as we
have seen) delayed for nine days before he determined to concentrate
his field-force and march on Badajoz, and this lateness would have
wrecked the combination, even if Marmont had been more ready than his
colleague.</p>

<p>Still there was some chance that the armies might have joined, if
Napoleon had not intervened with his misguided refusal to allow Marmont
to keep three divisions in the valley of the Tagus or to ‘worry about
affairs that did not concern him.’ Wellington could not know of these
orders: hence came his anxieties, and his determination to hurry the
siege of Badajoz to a conclusion at the earliest possible date. He was
never—as it turned out—in serious danger, but he could not possibly
be aware of the fact that Marmont was fettered by his instructions.
It was only the gradual accumulation of reports proving that the Army
of Portugal was moving against Ciudad Rodrigo, and not on Almaraz,
that finally gave him comparative ease of mind with regard to the
situation. As to Soult, he somewhat over-estimated his force, taking
it at 30,000 or even 35,000 men rather than the real 25,000: this
was, no doubt, the reason why he resolved to fight with his ‘covering
army’ ranged on the Albuera position, and not farther forward. If he
had known that on April 1 Soult had only 13,000 men at Monasterio,
and was still separated from Drouet, he might possibly have been more
enterprising.</p>

<p>No signs of Marmont’s arrival being visible, Wellington could afford
to contemplate with great equanimity Soult’s position at Villafranca
on April 7th. If the Marshal moved forward he would be beaten—but it
was almost certain that he would move back at once, for, as it will
be remembered, precautions had been taken to give him an alarming
distraction in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>
rear, by means of the operations of Penne Villemur and Ballasteros<a
id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.
This combination worked with perfect success, far more accurately than
Blake’s similar raid on Seville had done in June 1811. Ballasteros,
it is true, did much less than was in his power. He started from
his refuge under the guns of Gibraltar, passed down from the Ronda
mountains, and reached Utrera, in the plain of the Guadalquivir less
than twenty miles from Seville, on April 4. But he then swerved
away, having done more to alarm than to hurt the French, though he
had a force of 10,000 infantry and 800 horse<a id="FNanchor_303"
href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>, sufficient to have
put Seville in serious peril. But Penne Villemur and Morillo, though
they had not half the numbers of Ballasteros, accomplished all that
Wellington required: having slipped into the Condado de Niebla almost
unobserved, they pushed rapidly eastward, and occupied San Lucar la
Mayor, only twelve miles from Seville, on April 4, the same day that
Ballasteros appeared at Utrera. Their cavalry pushed up so boldly
toward the suburbs that they had to be driven off by cannon-shot from
the <i>tête-de-pont</i> at the bridge of Triana. General Rignoux, governor
of Seville, had a very motley and insufficient garrison, as Wellington
had calculated when he sent Penne Villemur forth. The only organized
units were a battalion of ‘Swiss’ Juramentados—really adventurers
of all nations—and a regiment of Spanish horse, making 1,500 men
altogether: the rest consisted of convalescents and weakly men
belonging to the regiments in the Cadiz Lines, and of 600 dismounted
dragoons. These made up some 2,000 men more, but many were not fit to
bear arms. In addition there were some companies of the recently raised
‘National Guards.’ The enormous size of Seville, and the weakness
of its old wall, compelled Rignoux to concentrate his force in the
fortified Cartuja convent, leaving only small posts at the gates and
the bridge. He sent at once, as Wellington had hoped, pressing appeals
to Soult, saying that he was beset by 14,000 men, and that the citizens
would probably rise and let in the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 6th Ballasteros received false news that Conroux was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span> marching against him with
the troops from the Cadiz Lines, and drew back into the mountains.
It is said that he was wilfully deceived by persons in the French
interest; at any rate he must have been badly served by his cavalry and
intelligence officers, who ought to have been able to tell him that
there was no foundation for the report. Penne and Morillo, however,
though disappointed at failing to meet their colleague’s army, made
a great parade of their small force under the walls of Seville, and
skirmished with the French at the bridge-head of Triana, and under
the walls of the Cartuja, so boldly that Rignoux expected a serious
attack. They could only have accomplished something more profitable if
the people of Seville had risen, but no disturbance took place. After
remaining in front of the place all the 7th and 8th of April, they
disappeared on the 9th, having received news of the fall of Badajoz,
and drawn the correct deduction that Soult would turn back to hunt them
when freed from his other task. Wellington, indeed, had written to give
them warning to that effect on the very morning that they retired<a
id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>: but
they anticipated the danger, and were safely behind the Rio Tinto when
Soult turned up in hot haste at Seville on the 11th, after four days of
exhausting forced marches.</p>

<p>The Marshal had left the two divisions of Drouet and Daricau with
Perreymond’s cavalry in Estremadura, to act as an observing force,
and had marched with his remaining 13,000 men to save Seville, which
owing to Ballasteros’s timidity had never been in any real danger. But
the Spanish diversion had nevertheless had precisely the effect that
Wellington had expected and desired. During Soult’s short absence of
twelve days great part of the open country of Andalusia had fallen out
of his control, the communications with La Mancha and King Joseph had
been cut off, and the guerrilleros had blockaded all the smaller French
posts. The hold of the invaders upon the kingdom was never so secure as
it had been before the fall of Badajoz.</p>

<p>Ballasteros, after his fiasco in front of Seville, made two
fruitless attempts against isolated French garrisons. He failed
at the Castle of Zahara on April 11th. One of his columns in
an assault on Osuna two days later got into the town and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> killed or captured 60
of the defenders, but failed to take the citadel, where the remainder
defended themselves till Pierre Soult was reported to be at hand,
and the Spaniards withdrew<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305"
class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. He ended his campaign of raids, however,
with a more successful stroke. Hearing that the brigadier Rey, with
three battalions and some dragoons, was marching from Malaga to relieve
the garrison of Ronda, he fell upon him at Alhaurin on the 14th with
his main body, encompassed him with fourfold strength, and drove him
in rout back to Malaga, capturing his two guns and inflicting more
than 200 casualties upon him<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. Ballasteros then hoped to seize on Malaga,
where the French were much alarmed, and prepared to shut themselves up
in the citadel of Gibalfaro. But the news that Pierre Soult and Conroux
were approaching with a strong column caused the Spaniards to retire
to the mountains above Gibraltar [April 19th]. Thus the operations in
Andalusia, which had opened with Soult’s march to Badajoz, came to an
end, with no ruinous disaster to the French, but with a diminution of
their prestige, and a distinct weakening of their hold on the kingdom.
In the Condado de Niebla Soult made no attempt to reoccupy lost ground,
and east of Granada his line of posts had recoiled considerably on the
Murcian side: Baza and Ubeda had been abandoned for good. It was but a
vain boast when the Marshal wrote to Berthier that, after he had set
all things to rights in the central parts of Andalusia, he intended
to organize a general concentration to crush Ballasteros, and that
his next task would be to lay siege for a second time to Tarifa, ‘the
loss of which place would be more injurious to the English and the
Insurgents than that of Alicante, or even that of Badajoz—against which
last-named fortress I ought to make no attack<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span> till I shall have finished matters
on the Tarifa side, and so have nothing to fear on my left flank<a
id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>.’</p>

<p>To complete the survey of the fortunes of the Army of the South in
April, it only remains that we should mention the doings of Drouet,
now left once more with his two old divisions to form the ‘corps of
observation’ opposite the Anglo-Portuguese. Soult during his retreat
had dropped his lieutenant at Llerena, with orders to give back on
Seville without fighting any serious action, if the enemy should
pursue him in force, but if he were left alone to hold his ground,
push his cavalry forward, and keep a strong detachment as near the
Upper Guadiana as possible. For only by placing troops at Campanario,
Medellin, and (if possible) Merida, could communication be kept up via
Truxillo and Almaraz with the Army of Portugal.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Drouet was not to be permitted to occupy such a
forward position as Soult would have liked. He was closely followed by
Stapleton Cotton, with Le Marchant’s and Slade’s heavy and Ponsonby’s<a
id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
light cavalry brigades, who brought his rearguard to action at
Villagarcia outside Llerena on April 11th. This was a considerable
fight. Drouet’s horse was in position to cover the retirement of his
infantry, with Lallemand’s dragoons in first line, and Perreymond’s
hussars and chasseurs in support. Lallemand evidently thought that
he had only Ponsonby’s brigade in front of him, as Le Marchant’s was
coming up by a side-road covered by hills, and Slade’s was far out of
sight to the rear. Accordingly he accepted battle on an equal front,
each side having three regiments in line. But, just as the charge was
delivered, the 5th Dragoon Guards, Le Marchant’s leading regiment,
came on the ground from the right, and, rapidly deploying, took the
French line in flank and completely rolled it up<a id="FNanchor_309"
href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. The enemy went to the
rear in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> confusion,
and the pursuit was continued till, half-way between Villagarcia and
Llerena, the French rallied on their reserve (2nd Hussars) behind a
broad ditch. Cotton, who had not let his men get out of hand, re-formed
Anson’s brigade and delivered a second successful charge, which drove
the French in upon Drouet’s infantry, which was in order of battle
to the left of Llerena town. It was impossible to do more, as three
cavalry brigades could not attack 12,000 men of all arms in a good
position. But a few hours later the whole French corps was seen in
retreat eastward: it retired to Berlanga and Azuaga on the watershed of
the Sierra Morena, completely abandoning Estremadura.</p>

<p>The French (outnumbered, if Slade’s brigade be counted, but it was
far to the rear and never put in line) lost 53 killed and wounded and
4 officers and 132 rank and file taken prisoners. Cotton’s casualties
were 14 killed and 2 officers and 35 men wounded: he insisted that
his success would have been much greater if Ponsonby had held back
a little longer, till the whole of Le Marchant’s squadrons came
on the field—Lallemand would then have been cut off from Llerena
and his line of retreat, and the greater part of his brigade ought
to have been captured, though the light cavalry in the second
line might have got off<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310"
class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. However, the affair was very creditable to
all concerned.</p>

<p>Hill’s infantry did not follow the retreating French, and had halted
about Almendralejo and Villafranca, only the cavalry having gone on in
pursuit to Llerena. The rest of the Anglo-Portuguese army was already
in movement for the North, as Wellington had given up the idea, which
had somewhat tempted him at first, of pursuing Soult to Seville and
trying to upset the whole fabric of French power in Andalusia. Of this
more in its due place. Suffice it to say here that he fell back on his
old partition of forces, leaving Hill in Estremadura as his ‘corps of
observation’, with precisely the same force that he had been<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> given in 1811, save
that one British cavalry brigade (that of Slade) was added. The rest
of the corps consisted of the 2nd Division, Hamilton’s two Portuguese
brigades, Long’s British and John Campbell’s Portuguese horse<a
id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. The
whole amounted to about 14,000 men, sufficient not only to hold Drouet
in check, but also to keep an eye upon the French troops in the valley
of the Tagus, against whom Wellington was now meditating a raid of the
sort that he had already sketched out in his correspondence with Hill
in February.</p>

<p>So much for the Army of Andalusia and its fortunes in April 1812. We
must now turn to those of Marmont and the Army of Portugal during the
same critical weeks.</p>

<p>The Duke of Ragusa, as it will be remembered, had been caught
at Salamanca, on March 27th, by Napoleon’s dispatch giving him an
over-late option of detaching troops to the relief of Badajoz. But
being already committed to the invasion of Portugal prescribed by
the Emperor’s earlier letters, and having his field-force and his
magazines disposed for that project, he had resolved to proceed with
it, though he had no great belief in the results that would follow
from his taking the offensive<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312"
class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. As he informed his master, there was
nothing at which he could strike effectively. ‘It would seem that
His Majesty thinks that Lord Wellington has magazines close behind
the frontier of northern Portugal. Not so. These magazines are at
Abrantes, or in Estremadura. His hospitals are at Lisbon, Castello
Branco, and Abrantes. There is nothing of any importance to him on the
Coa.’ And how was Almeida or Ciudad Rodrigo to be assailed in such a
way as to cause Wellington any disquietude, when the Army of Portugal
had not a single heavy gun left? ‘General Dorsenne had the happy idea
of leaving in Rodrigo, a fortress of inferior character on the front
of our line, the whole siege-train prepared for this army at great
expense, so that new guns of large calibre must actually be brought
up from France.’</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p.
280]</span></p> <p>Marmont’s striking force was not so large as he
would have wished. Bonnet was, by the Emperor’s orders, beginning his
advance for the reoccupation of the Asturias. Foy was in the valley
of the Tagus. Souham had to be left on the Esla, to observe the Army
of Galicia. This left five divisions for active operations: but the
Marshal came to the conclusion that he must split up one more (Ferey’s)
to hold Valladolid, Salamanca, Zamora, Toro, Avila, Benavente, and
other places, which in an elaborate calculation sent to Berthier he
showed to require 4,910 men for their garrisons. He therefore marched
with four infantry divisions only [Clausel, Maucune, Sarrut, Brennier]
and 1,500 light cavalry, about 25,000 men in all: his division of
dragoons was left behind in Leon, to keep open communication between
his various garrisons. A rather illusory help was sought by sending to
Foy, who then lay at Almaraz, orders to the effect that he might push
a detachment to Plasencia, and give out that he was about to join the
main army by the pass of Perales. But Foy’s real concern, as he was
told, was to keep up communication with the Army of the South, and to
give any help that was possible on the side of Truxillo, if (by some
improbable chance) the Army of the Centre should be able to lend him
the aid of any appreciable number of battalions.</p>

<p>On the 30th the French army appeared in front of Rodrigo, and Carlos
de España, leaving 3,000 men as garrison there, under General Vives,
retired with the small remainder of his division towards the Portuguese
frontier. He was pursued and molested by the enemy’s cavalry, not
having been covered or assisted, as Wellington had directed, by
Victor Alten’s regiment of German Hussars. That officer, neglecting
his orders in the most flagrant fashion, did not retire slowly and
in a fighting posture, when the French drove in his line of vedettes
in front of Rodrigo, but collected his regiment and rode hard for
Castello Branco, without concerning himself in the least as to the
safety of the Spanish and Portuguese forces in his neighbourhood,
or the procuring of intelligence as to the strength and the purpose
of the French army. His carelessness or shirking of responsibility,
which was to be displayed in still worse form as the campaign went
on, drew on him such a sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p.
281]</span> and bitter rebuke from Wellington that it is a wonder that
he was not sent home forthwith<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313"
class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<p>Marmont looked at Rodrigo, but refused to attempt anything against
it, though he was informed that the garrison was undisciplined and
dispirited. Without siege artillery he held that it was useless
to attack the place. After sending in a formal summons to Vives
(who gave the proper negative answer in round terms), and throwing
into the streets a few shells from the howitzers attached to his
field-batteries, he told off Brennier’s division to blockade Rodrigo,
as also to guard a flying bridge which he cast across the Agueda at La
Caridad, a few miles up-stream.</p>

<p>His next move was to send forward Clausel with two divisions to
investigate the state of Almeida. He had heard that its walls were
unfinished, and thought that there might be some chance of executing a
<i>coup-de-main</i> against it. The general, however, came back next day,
reporting that he thought the scheme impossible. He had apparently been
deterred from pressing in upon the place both by the defiant attitude
of the governor, Le Mesurier, whose outposts skirmished outside the
walls for some time before allowing themselves to be driven in, and
still more by the sight of a considerable force of Portuguese troops
encamped close to the town on the other side of the Coa. This was
Trant’s militia, the first detachment that had got to the front of the
various bodies of troops which Wellington had told off for the defence
of the Beira. They had taken up the strong position behind the bridge
of the Coa, which Craufurd had so obstinately defended against Ney in
July 1810.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span>On the alarm
being given on March 29th that Marmont was marching against that
province, and not against Galicia or the Tras-os-Montes, Wellington’s
orders suiting that contingency were carried out with more or less
accuracy. Silveira, with the Tras-os-Montes militia and his small body
of regular cavalry, began to move on Lamego, where Baccelar, the chief
commander in the North, had concentrated the regiments from the Oporto
region and the Beira Alta, even before Marmont had left Salamanca.
General Abadia had been requested to press forward against the French
on the Esla, so as to threaten the flank and rear of the invading
army. He did not accomplish much, being convinced that the forces
left opposite him were too strong to be lightly meddled with. But he
directed a raid to be made from the Western Asturias towards the city
of Leon, and the division at Puebla de Senabria threatened Benavente.
Both movements were executed too late to be of any importance in
affecting the course of the campaign.</p>

<p>Baccelar had been ordered to avoid committing himself to a general
action with any large body of the enemy, but to show such a mass
of troops concentrated that Marmont would have to keep his main
body together, and to act cautiously on the offensive. His primary
duty was to cover, if possible, the large magazines at São João de
Pesqueira and Lamego on the Douro, and the smaller ones at Villa
da Ponte, Pinhel, and Celorico. To these Wellington attached much
importance, as they were the intermediate dépôts from which his army
drew its sustenance when it was on the northern frontier, and he knew
that he would be requiring them again ere many weeks had passed. As
long as Marmont remained near Almeida, it was necessary to keep a
force as far forward as possible, behind the very defensible line
of the Coa, and Trant was advanced for this purpose, though he was
directed not to commit himself. His presence so close to Almeida was
very valuable, as he would have to be driven off before the Marshal
formally invested the place. Le Mesurier, the governor, was not at
all comfortable as to his position: though he had a proportion of
British artillery left with him, the whole of the infantry of the
garrison consisted of Beira militia, who had no experience under arms.
On taking over charge of the place, on March 18, the governor<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span> had complained that
though the walls were in a sufficient state of repair, and there were
plenty of guns forthcoming, yet few or none of them were mounted ready
for service, the powder magazines were insufficiently sheltered, and
many details of fortification (palisades, platforms, &amp;c.) had
to be completed in a hurry<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314"
class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. However, the place looked so sound for
defence when Clausel reconnoitred it, that—as we have seen—he made no
attempt to invest it, and promptly withdrew, reporting to his chief
that Almeida was not to be taken by a <i>coup-de-main</i>.</p>

<p>Marmont then made the move which Wellington had most desired, and
which in his dispatch to Baccelar he had specified as the happiest
thing that could come about. Instead of sitting down before Almeida or
Ciudad Rodrigo, or making a push against the dépôts on the Douro, he
turned southward towards the Lower Beira, and (leaving Brennier behind
to guard communications) marched with three divisions to Sabugal via
Fuente Guinaldo. This policy could have no great results—the Marshal
might ravage the country-side, but such a movement with such a force
could not possibly alarm Wellington overmuch, or draw him away from
the siege of Badajoz if he were determined to persevere in it. There
was nothing of importance to him in central Beira—only minor dépôts at
Celorico and Castello Branco, much less valuable than the larger ones
at Lamego and São João de Pesqueira on the Douro. ‘He can do no more,’
as an acute observer on the Portuguese staff remarked, ‘than drive off
some cattle, burn some cottages, and ruin a few wretched peasants<a
id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.’ For
the country about the sources of the Zezere and round Castello Branco
is one of the most thinly peopled districts of Portugal.</p>

<p>To meet Marmont’s southern move Baccelar brought up Trant’s and
Wilson’s militia by a parallel march to Guarda, while Le Cor, with the
two regiments of the Beira Baixa, held on at Castello Branco till he
should be evicted from it. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[p.
284]</span> Wellington’s intense disgust<a id="FNanchor_316"
href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>, Victor Alten, whose
orders directed him to fall back no farther than that town, continued
his precipitate retreat with the German Hussars to the bridge of
Villa Velha on the Tagus, and began to take measures to destroy
that all-important link of communications between north and south.
Fortunately he was stopped before he had done the damage. The bridge
was only taken over to the south bank, not committed to the flames.</p>

<p>Halting at Sabugal, on April 8th, Marmont sent out flying columns,
which ravaged the country-side as far as Penamacor, Fundão, and
Covilhão, and dispatched Clausel with a whole division against Castello
Branco, the one important place in the whole region. Le Cor evacuated
it on April 12th, after burning such of the magazines as could not be
removed in haste: and Clausel—who occupied it for two days—did not
therefore get possession of the stores of food which his chief had
hoped to find there. In revenge the town and the small proportion of
its inhabitants who did not take to the hills were badly maltreated:
many buildings, including the bishop’s palace, were burnt.</p>

<p>Hearing that Marmont had dispersed the larger portion of his army
with flying columns, and was lying at Sabugal, on the 12th, with only
a few thousand men, Trant conceived the rash idea that it would be
possible to surprise him, at his head-quarters, by a night march of
his own and Wilson’s combined divisions from Guarda. The distance was
about twenty miles over mountain roads, and the scheme must have led to
disaster, for—contrary to the information which the militia generals
had gathered—the Marshal’s concentrated main body was still stronger
than their own, despite of all his detachments<a id="FNanchor_317"
href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span> ‘You could not have succeeded in
your attempt, and you would have lost your division and that
of General Wilson<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318"
class="fnanchor">[318]</a>,’ wrote Wellington to Trant, when the scheme
and its failure were reported to him a week later. It was fortunately
never tried, owing to Baccelar’s having made objections to his
subordinate’s hare-brained plan.</p>

<p>But the best comment on the enterprise is that on the very night
(April 13-14) which Trant had fixed for his march, he was himself
surprised by Marmont, so bad had been his arrangements for watching the
country-side. The Marshal had learnt that there was an accumulation
of militia at Guarda threatening his flank, and resolved to give it
a lesson. He started with a brigade each from Sarrut’s and Maucune’s
divisions and five squadrons of light cavalry—about 7,000 men—and was,
at dawn, on the 14th, at the foot of the hill of Guarda, where he had
the good luck to cut off all Trant’s outposts without their firing a
shot—so badly did the militia keep their look-out. ‘Had he only dashed
headlong into the town he might have captured Wilson’s and my divisions
without losing probably a single man,’ wrote Trant. But the ascent into
Guarda was long and steep, and Marmont, who had only cavalry up, did
not guess how careless were his adversaries. He took proper military
precautions and waited for his infantry: meanwhile the Portuguese were
roused, almost by chance as it seems. ‘My distrust of the militia with
regard to the execution of precautions,’ continues Trant, ‘had induced
me at all times to have a drummer at my bedroom door, in readiness to
beat to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> arms. This
was most fortunately the case on the night of April 13, 1812, for the
first intimation that I had of the enemy being near at hand was given
me by my servant, on bringing me my coffee at daybreak on the 14th. He
said that there was such a report in the street, and that the soldiers
were assembling at the alarm rendezvous. I instantly beat to arms, and
the beat being as instantly taken up by every drummer in the place,
Marmont, who was at that very moment with his cavalry at the entrance
of the town, held back. I was myself the first man out of the town, and
he was not then 400 yards away<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319"
class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Marshal, in his account of the affair, says that the Portuguese
formed up on the heights by the town, apparently ready to fight, but
drew off rapidly so soon as he had prepared for a regular attack on
the position. Wise not quite in time, the two militia generals sent
their men at a trot down the steep road at the back of the place, with
the single troop of regular dragoons that they possessed bringing up
the rear. It had now begun to rain in torrents, and Trant and Wilson
having obtained two or three miles start, and being able to see no
distance owing to the downpour, thought that they had got off safe.
This was not the case: Marmont realized that his infantry could not
catch them, but seeing their hurry and disorder ordered his cavalry—his
own escort-squadron and the 13th Chasseurs—to pursue and charge the
rearguard of the retreating column. They overtook it by the bridge of
Faya, three miles outside Guarda, where the road to Celorico descends
on a steep slope to cross the river. The leading French squadron
scattered the forty dragoons at the tail of Trant’s division, and rode
on, mixed with them, against the rearguard battalion (that of Oporto).
The militiamen, startled and caught utterly by surprise, tried to
form across the road and to open fire: but the rain had damped their
cartridges, and hardly a musket gave fire. Thereupon the battalion went
to pieces, the men nearest the French throwing down their guns and
asking for quarter, while those behind scattered uphill or downhill
from the road, seeking safety on the steep slopes. The charge swept
downhill on to the battalion of Aveiro, and the other successive<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span> units of the Oporto
brigade, which broke up in confusion. Five of their six colours were
taken, and 1,500 prisoners were cut off, while some tumbled into
the Mondego and were drowned, by losing their footing on the steep
hillside. Hardly a Frenchman fell, and not very many Portuguese, for
the <i>chasseurs</i>, finding that they had to deal with helpless militiamen
who made no resistance, were sparing with the sabre<a id="FNanchor_320"
href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. The greater part of
the prisoners were allowed, in contempt, to make off, and only a few
hundred and the five flags were brought back to Marmont at Guarda. The
pursuit did not penetrate so far as Wilson’s division, which got across
the Mondego while Trant’s was being routed, and formed up behind the
narrow bridge, where the <i>chasseurs</i>, being a trifling force of 400
men, did not think fit to attack them. The French infantry had marched
over twenty miles already that day, and were dead beat: Marmont did not
send them down from Guarda to pursue, in spite of the brilliant success
of his cavalry.</p>

<p>The day after the ‘Rout of Guarda’ Marmont pushed an advanced
guard to Lagiosa, half-way to Celorico, where Trant and Wilson had
taken refuge, with their ranks short of some 2,000 men scattered in
the hills. Thereupon the militia generals set fire to the stores, and
evacuated Celorico, falling back into the hills towards Trancoso. But
finding that the French were not coming on, they halted; and when they
ascertained that the enemy was actually returning to Guarda, they came
back, extinguished the fires, and rescued great part of the magazines.
Marmont’s unexpected forbearance was caused by the fact that the news
of the fall of Badajoz reached him on the 15th, along with a report
from Clausel (who had just evacuated Castello Branco) that Wellington’s
army had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span> already
started northward, and that its advanced guard was across the Tagus at
Villa Velha.</p>

<p>This was startling, nay appalling, intelligence. Badajoz had been
reckoned good for a much longer resistance, and the news had come so
slowly—it had taken nine days to reach Marmont—that it was possible
that the British army was already in a position to cut off his
expeditionary force from its base on the Agueda. Wherefore Marmont
hastily evacuated Guarda, and was back at Sabugal by the 16th, where
Clausel and the other dispersed fractions of his army joined him. Here
he regarded himself as reasonably safe, but determined to retire behind
the Spanish frontier ere long, raising the blockade of Ciudad Rodrigo.
‘My troops,’ he wrote to Berthier on that day, ‘have used up the little
food to be gathered between the Tagus and the Zezere; and now that
the enemy is on the Tagus I cannot possibly remain on the Mondego, as
I should be leaving him on my line of communications. I shall fall
back to the right bank of the Agueda. If the enemy resolves to pursue
me thither I shall fight him. If not I shall fall back on Salamanca,
because of the absolute impossibility of feeding an army between the
Agueda and the Tormes.’</p>

<p>Marmont remained at Sabugal and its neighbourhood for nearly a
week—by the 22nd he had drawn back a few miles to Fuente Guinaldo—with
about 20,000 men. His position was more dangerous than he knew; for
on the 18th the heavy rains, which began on the day of the combat of
Guarda, broke his bridge over the Agueda at La Caridad, so that he was
cut off from Brennier and from Salamanca. He was under the impression
that Wellington had only brought up a couple of divisions against him,
and that these were still south of Castello Branco<a id="FNanchor_321"
href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> whereas as a matter of fact seven
had marched; and on the day that he wrote this incautious estimate
Wellington’s headquarters were at Penamacor, the Light and 3rd
Divisions were closing in on Sabugal, the 4th and 5th were a full march
north of Castello Branco, and the 1st, 6th, and 7th were at Losa, quite
close to that city. Thirty-six hours more of delay would have placed
Marmont in the terrible position of finding himself with a broken
bridge behind him, and 40,000 enemies closing in upon his front and
flank.</p>

<p>To explain the situation, Wellington’s movements after the capture
of Badajoz must now be detailed. It had been his hope, though not
his expectation, that Soult might have remained at Villafranca after
hearing of the disaster of the 6th April; in this case he had intended
to fall upon him with every available man, crush him by force of
numbers, and then follow up his routed army into Andalusia, where the
whole fabric of French occupation must have crumpled up. But Soult
wisely retreated at a sharp pace; and the idea of following him as
far as Seville, there to find him reinforced for a general action by
all the troops from the Cadiz Lines and Granada, was not so tempting
as that of bringing him to battle in Estremadura. On the day after
the fall of Badajoz Wellington formulated his intentions in a letter
to Lord Liverpool. ‘It would be very desirable that I should have it
in my power to strike a blow against Marshal Soult, before he could
be reinforced.... But it is not very probable that he will risk an
action in the province of Estremadura, which it would not be difficult
for him to avoid; and it is necessary for him that he should return
to Andalusia owing to the movements of General Ballasteros and the
Conde de Penne Villemur ... if he should retire into Andalusia I
must return to Castille<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322"
class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.’</p>

<p>The reason given by Wellington for his resolve to turn north again
was that Carlos de España had informed him that Ciudad Rodrigo, though
otherwise tenable enough, had only provisions<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span> for twenty-three days, partly from what
Wellington called the general policy of ‘Mañana’<a id="FNanchor_323"
href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>—of shiftless
procrastination—partly from the definite single fact that a very large
convoy provided from the British magazines on the Douro had been
stopped at Almeida on March 30th. This, in Wellington’s estimation,
was the fault of Victor Alten, who, if he had held the outposts beyond
the Agueda for a day longer, might have covered the entry of the
convoy into Ciudad Rodrigo<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324"
class="fnanchor">[324]</a>. Marmont’s operations on the Coa and the
Agueda would have been quite negligible from the strategic point
of view but for this one fact. He might ravage as far as Guarda or
Castello Branco without doing any practical harm, but it could not be
permitted that he should starve Rodrigo into surrender: even allowing
for a firm resistance by the garrison, and a judicious resort to
lessened rations, the place would be in danger from the third week of
April onward. Wherefore, unless Marmont withdrew into Spain by the
middle of the month, he must be forced to do so, by the transference of
the main body of the Anglo-Portuguese Army to the North.</p>

<p>The Marshal, during the critical days following the fall of Badajoz,
showed no such intention. Indeed he advanced to Sabugal on the 8th,
seized Castello Branco on the 12th, and executed his raid on Guarda
upon the 13th-14th. Ignorant of the fall of Badajoz, he was naturally
extending the sphere of his operations, under the belief that no
serious force was in his front. While he was overrunning Beira Baixa,
Ciudad Rodrigo continued to be blockaded by Brennier, and its stores
were now running very low.</p>

<p>On April 11th<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325"
class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Wellington made up his mind that this
state of things must be brought to an end, and he determined that
no mere detachment should march, but a force sufficient to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span> overwhelm Marmont if he
could be brought to action. The movement began with the march of the
11th Light Dragoons and Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese to Elvas on
the afternoon of the 11th April, all being ordered to move on Arronches
and Portalegre. On the 12th a larger force started off from the camps
around Badajoz and on the Albuera position: the 3rd and Light Divisions
moved (following Pack and Bradford) on Portalegre via Arronches, the
4th and 5th, making a shorter move, to Campo Mayor on the same road,
the 7th from Valverde to Elvas. The 1st and 6th under Graham, bringing
up the rear, went off on the 13th from Valverde and Elvas northward.
Orders were sent to Stapleton Cotton, then in pursuit of Drouet in
southern Estremadura, to come with Anson’s and Le Marchant’s cavalry
brigades to join the main army, leaving only Slade’s and Long’s to
Hill. Bock’s Heavy Dragoon brigade of the King’s German Legion was also
directed to take part in the general movement.</p>

<p>Only Hill, with the troops that had served under him since the
summer of 1811, plus one new cavalry brigade, was left behind in
Estremadura to ‘contain’ Drouet. It was highly unlikely that Soult
would be heard of in that province, as he had his own troubles in
Andalusia to keep him employed. Indeed Wellington in his parting
message to this trusty lieutenant told him that it was ‘impossible’
that the enemy could assemble enough troops to incommode him at
present, and explained that his chief duty would be to cover the
repairing of Badajoz, into which three Portuguese line regiments<a
id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> under
Power, hitherto forming the garrisons of Elvas and Abrantes, were
thrown, to hold it till Castaños should provide 3,000 Spaniards for the
purpose.</p>

<p>The movement of the army marching against Marmont was rapid and
continuous, though it might have been even more swift but for the fact
that the whole long column had to pass the bridge of Villa Velha, the
only passage of the Tagus that lay straight on the way to the Lower
Beira: to send troops by Abrantes would have cost too much time. On
the 16th the Light and 3rd Divisions crossed the bridge, on the 17th
some cavalry and Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese, while the 4th,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> 5th, and 6th Divisions
were now close to the river at Castello de Vide and Alpalhão, and
only the 1st was rather to the rear at Portalegre<a id="FNanchor_327"
href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>. Alten’s German
Hussars, picked up at Castello Branco on the 18th by the head of the
column, were the only cavalry which Wellington showed in his front.
This was done on principle: Marmont knew that this regiment was in
his neighbourhood, and if it pressed in upon his outposts, it told
him nothing as to the arrival of new troops opposite him. As we have
already seen, when quoting one of his dispatches<a id="FNanchor_328"
href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>, he drew the inference
that Wellington intended, and so late as the 22nd believed that his
adversary’s main army was still behind the Tagus, and that at most two
divisions had come up to Villa Velha—but probably no further.</p>

<p>Steadily advancing, the column, with the 3rd and Light Divisions
leading, reached Castello Branco on the 17th. They found that it had
been reoccupied on the 15th by Alten’s Hussars and Le Cor’s militia;
but it was in a dreadful state of dilapidation owing to the ravages
of Clausel’s troops during the two days of their flying visit. Clear
information was received that Marmont was still at Sabugal, and his
vedettes lay as far south as Pedrogão. The British staff were in hopes
that he might be caught. ‘His ignorance (as we hope) of the real force
in march against him may end in his destruction,’ wrote D’Urban to
Charles Stewart on the 18th, ‘for he has put the Agueda in his rear,
which the late rains have made impassable: his situation is very
critical. If he discovers his error at once, he may get off by his
left down the Perales road, and so reach Plasencia: but if he does
not, and waits to be <i>driven</i> out of the ground he holds, I don’t see
how he is to get away. Lord Wellington will be all closed up by the
21st; meanwhile he shows little to his front, and avoids giving serious
alarm: the fairest hopes may be entertained of a decisive blow<a
id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.’</p>

<p>It looked indeed as if Marmont was waiting over-long: on the
17th-18th his exploring parties came as far south as Idanha Nova,
where by an ill chance they captured Wellington’s most famous
intelligence-officer, Major Colquhoun Grant, who there<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span> commenced that
extraordinary series of adventures which are told in detail in the
life of his brother-in-law, Dr. McGrigor, Wellington’s chief medical
officer. He escaped at Bayonne, and returned to England via Paris and
the boat of a Breton fisherman<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330"
class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.</p>

<p>The rear of the column had dropped behind somewhat, owing to the
incessant rains which had set in from April 14th, and which had broken
Marmont’s bridge four days later. Wellington had given the 4th Division
leave to halt for a day, because of the state of the roads and the
entire want of cover for the night in the desolate tract between
Villa Velha and Abrantes<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331"
class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. It reached Castello Branco, however, on
the 20th, on which day only (by some extraordinary mismanagement)
Wellington got the tardy news of Trant’s disaster at Guarda on the
morning of the 14th. And this news was brought not by any official
messenger, but by a fugitive ensign of militia, who garnished it with
all manner of untrue additions—whereupon Beresford had him tried and
shot, for deserting his troops and spreading false intelligence.
Clearly Trant, Wilson, and Baccelar between them should have got the
true narrative to head-quarters before six days had elapsed.</p>

<p>The 21st April was the critical day of this campaign. Marmont was
still at Fuente Guinaldo, on the wrong side of the Agueda, and his
bridge at La Caridad was still broken and not relaid. Though unaware
that Wellington was close upon him with an overwhelming force, whose
existence he denied (as we have seen) in a letter sent off so late
as the 22nd, he was yet feeling uncomfortable, both because of his
broken communications, and because he had used up his food. Wherefore
he gave orders that his artillery, using very bad side-roads, should
pass the Agueda by the bridge of Villarubia, a small mountain<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> crossing quite near its
source, which would take it, not by the ordinary route past Ciudad
Rodrigo, but by Robledo to Tamames, through a very difficult country.<a
id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> He
himself with the infantry stood fast on the 21st and 22nd, unaware of
his dangerous position.</p>

<p>For the allies were closing in upon him—the head-quarters of
Wellington were on the 21st at Pedrogão, the 1st German Hussars,
covering the advance, had reached Sabugal, and the Light and 3rd
Divisions were close behind, as were Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese,
while the 4th and 5th were both beyond Castello Branco. On the morning
of the 22nd the head of the infantry column had passed Sabugal, and the
Hussars were in front of them, pushing in Marmont’s vedettes. A delay
of twenty-four hours more on the part of the French would have brought
the armies into collision, when Marmont gave orders for his infantry
to retreat across the Agueda by the fords near Ciudad Rodrigo, where
the water on that day had at last fallen enough to render the passage
possible, though difficult and dangerous. The leading division marched
on the 22nd, the rest on the 23rd: by the night of the latter day all
were across the river, and retiring rapidly on Salamanca; for, as
Marmont truly observed, there was not a ration of food to be got out of
the devastated country between Rodrigo and the Tormes.</p>

<p>The odd part of this sudden, if long-deferred, retreat was that
it was made without the slightest knowledge that it was imperative,
owing to Wellington’s near approach; in the letter announcing it to
Berthier the Marshal reiterates his statement that he does not believe
that Wellington has a man north of Castello Branco save the 1st
Hussars K.G.L. The retreat is only ordered because it is clear that,
with 20,000 men only in hand, it is useless to continue the tour of
devastation in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>
Beira. ‘Your highness may judge that the result of the diversion which
I have sought to make in favour of the Army of the South has been
practically nil. Such a movement could only be effective if carried out
with a force great enough to enable me to march against the enemy with
confidence, and to offer him battle, even if he had every available
man collected. With 18,000 or 19,000 men (reduced to 15,000 or 16,000
because I have to leave detachments to keep up communications) I
could not move far into Portugal without risk, even if I have no one
in front of me, and the whole hostile army is on the farther bank of
the Tagus. For if I passed the Zezere and marched on Santarem, the
enemy—master of Badajoz and covered by the Guadiana—could pass the
Tagus behind me, and seize the defiles of Zarza Major, Perales, and
Payo, by which alone I could return.... There are several places at
which he could cross the Tagus, above and below Alcantara, and so place
himself by a rapid and secret movement that my first news of him would
be by the sound of cannon on my line of communications—and my position
would then be desperate<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.’</p>

<p>The real danger that was threatening him, on the day that he wrote
this dispatch, Marmont did not suspect in the least, indeed he denied
its existence. But he moved just in time, and was across the Agueda
when, on the 24th, Wellington had his head-quarters at Alfayates, and
three divisions at Fuente Guinaldo, which the French had only evacuated
on the preceding day, with three more close behind. Only the 1st and
6th, under Graham, were still at Castello Branco and Losa. Evidently if
the fords of the Agueda had remained impassable for another twenty-four
hours, Marmont’s four divisions would have been overwhelmed by superior
numbers and driven against the bridgeless river, over which there would
have been no escape. As it was, he avoided an unsuspected danger, and
returned to Salamanca with his army little reduced in numbers, but with
his cavalry and artillery almost ruined: his dispatch of the 22nd says
that he has lost 1,500 horses, and that as many more needed a long rest
if they were ever again to be fit for service.</p>

<p>On the 24th Wellington bade all his army halt, the forced<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span> marches which they had
been carrying out for the last ten days having failed to achieve
the end of surprising and overwhelming Marmont, who had obtained
an undeserved escape. On the 26th he paid a flying visit to Ciudad
Rodrigo, whose safety he had at least secured, and commended General
Vives for his correct attitude during the three weeks of the late
blockade. The next movements of the allied army belong to a different
series of operations, and must be dealt with in a new section.</p>

  <p class="subh2">THE SALAMANCA CAMPAIGN</p>
  <h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
  <p class="subh3">KING JOSEPH AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On March</span> 16, 1812, the day on which
Wellington opened his trenches before Badajoz, the Emperor Napoleon
took a step of no small importance with regard to the control of his
armies in Spain. He had now made up his mind that the long-threatened
war with Russia must begin within a few months, and that he must leave
Paris ere long, and move forward to some central point in Germany,
from which he could superintend the preparations for a campaign, the
greatest in scale of any which he had hitherto undertaken. He was
persuaded that war was inevitable: the Czar Alexander had dared to
dispute his will; and in the state of megalomania, to which his mind
had now accustomed itself, he could tolerate no opposition. Yet he was
aware, in his more lucid moments, that he was taking a great risk. On
March 7th Colonel Jardet, Marmont’s confidential aide-de-camp, was
granted an interview, in which he set forth all the difficulties of
the Army of Portugal. The Emperor heard him out, and began, ‘Marmont
complains that he is short of many resources—food, money, means,
&amp;c.... Well, here am I, about to plunge with an immense army into
the heart of a great country which produces <i>absolutely nothing</i>.’ And
then he stopped, and after a long silence seemed suddenly to rouse
himself from a sombre reverie, and looking the colonel in the face
asked, ‘How will it all end?’ Jardet, thrown off his balance by such
a searching query, stammered that it would of course end in the best
possible fashion. But he went out filled with gloomy forebodings,
inspired by his master’s evident lack of confidence in the future<a
id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

<p>Some weeks were yet to elapse before the Emperor’s actual<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span> departure from France;
but, ere he went, he had to set in good working order the conduct of
his policy during his absence, and of all its complicated machinery
the Spanish section was one of the most puzzling and the most apt to
get out of order. It was clearly impossible that he should continue to
send from Dresden or Wilna elaborate orders every five or ten days,
as he had been wont to do from Paris. If it took three weeks to get
an order to Seville in February, it might take five or six in July,
when the imperial head-quarters might be in some obscure Lithuanian
hamlet. Something must be done to solve the problem of continuous
policy, and of co-operation between the five armies of Spain, and
after much consideration the Emperor dictated to Berthier the solution
which he thought least bad—’Send by special messenger a dispatch to
the King of Spain, informing him that I confide to him the command
of all my Spanish armies, and that Marshal Jourdan will serve as
his Chief-of-the-Staff. You will send, at the same time, a similar
intimation to that marshal. You will inform the King that I shall keep
him advised of my political intentions through my ambassador at Madrid.
You will write to Marshal Suchet, to the Duke of Dalmatia, and the
Duke of Ragusa that I have entrusted the King with the charge of all
my armies in his realm, and that they will have to conform to all the
orders which they may receive from the King, to secure the co-operation
of their armies. You will write, in particular, to the Duke of Ragusa
that the necessity for obtaining common action between the Armies of
the South, of Valencia, and of Portugal, has determined me to give
the King of Spain control over all of them, and that he will have to
regulate his operations by the instructions which he will receive.
To-morrow you will write in greater detail to the King, but the special
messenger must start this very night for Bayonne<a id="FNanchor_335"
href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>.’</p>

<p>Of the bundle of dispatches that for the King was delivered at
Madrid on March 28th, after twelve days of travel. Marmont<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span> got his a little later,
as he had started on his Portuguese expedition when it reached
Salamanca. Communication between his field-force and his base being
difficult, owing to the activity of Julian Sanchez, it appears to
have been on March 30, when before Ciudad Rodrigo, that he became
aware that he had a new commander-in-chief<a id="FNanchor_336"
href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>. Soult was apprised of
the situation much later, because, when preparing for his expedition to
relieve Badajoz, he had ordered his posts in the Sierra Morena to be
evacuated, and the communication with La Mancha to be broken off for
the moment. It seems that he must have got Berthier’s dispatch quite
late in April, as on the 17th of that month he was only acknowledging
Paris letters of February 23rd<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337"
class="fnanchor">[337]</a>, and the first courier from Madrid got
through only some time later. Suchet would appear also to have been
advised of the change of command very late—he published the imperial
decree in his official gazette at Valencia only on May 10, giving as
its date the 29th instead of the 16th of March<a id="FNanchor_338"
href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>, which looks as if the
first copy sent to him had miscarried, and the repetition made thirteen
days later had alone reached him. These dates are only worth giving as
illustrations of the extreme difficulty of getting orders from point to
point in Spain during the French occupation, even when Andalusia and
Valencia were supposed to be thoroughly subdued.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in Napoleon’s instructions to Berthier
no mention is made of either the Army of Catalonia or the
Army of the North<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a>; and it might have been thought that,
clinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span> to the
theory of his paper annexation of Spain north of the Ebro, he was
deliberately exempting from the King’s control the troops in the
districts on which he had resolved to lay hands for his own benefit.
But a supplementary dispatch of April 23rd placed Decaen and the
garrison of Catalonia under the general charge of Suchet, and as that
marshal had been directed to obey King Joseph’s military instructions,
the four new ‘French’ departments on the Ebro were now theoretically
under the same general command as the rest of Spain. As to the Army
of the North, Dorsenne wrote (April 19th), with evident glee, to say
that he was exempted from obedience to the King, by not being included
in the list of recipients of the dispatch of March 16, and that he
regretted his inability to carry out a series of orders which Jourdan
had sent him. But he had not many more days to serve in his present
capacity, and his successor, Caffarelli, though equally recalcitrant
in spirit, presently received a formal notice that he was under King
Joseph’s command.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s general policy in placing the supreme control of
all the Spanish armies in the hands of one chief, and bringing to
an end (in theory at least) the system of separate viceroyalties
was undoubtedly the right one. And it cannot be disputed that one
second-rate commander-in-chief is more effective than four good ones,
working each for his own private and local profit and glory. But in
this particular case the new arrangement was not likely to bring about
any great change for the better, owing to the personal equation.
During the last three years Napoleon had been inflicting affronts at
short intervals upon his brother, had annexed integral portions of
his realm, had disregarded most of his complaints and suggestions,
and had allowed him to become the butt of the viceroys, whose insults
and injuries he had never been allowed to resent. They had raided the
districts assigned to his personal governance<a id="FNanchor_340"
href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>, had plundered his
magazines, imprisoned his officials, and set up courts of justice
of their own to supersede the regular magistracy of the land. The
Emperor had never punished such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p.
301]</span> proceedings; at the most he had ordered that they should
cease, when they were injurious to the progress of the French arms
in Spain. It was useless to issue a sudden order that for the future
the marshals were under Joseph’s control, and that ‘he must make them
obey him,’ as the phrase ran in one letter to Madrid. As the King’s
minister, Miot de Melito, wrote, ‘What chance was there of success when
all the individuals concerned were at variance with each other? The
marshals had been accustomed for three years to absolute independence.
The new Chief-of-the-Staff, in spite of his acknowledged capacity,
was known to be out of favour with the Emperor, and in consequence
could exercise no moral authority over the masters of the armies.
The apparent testimonial of confidence which was given to the King,
by making him Commander-in-Chief, was a matter to cause disquietude
rather than satisfaction<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341"
class="fnanchor">[341]</a>.’ The plain fact was that Napoleon was
over-busy, worried with other problems, and he merely took the easiest
and simplest method of throwing the burden of the Spanish war on to the
shoulders of another. The consequences, be they what they might be,
were now of little importance, compared with the success or failure of
the impending Russian campaign.</p>

<p>Jourdan sums up the situation in much the same terms. ‘The King
for two years had been allowed to have no direct relations with
the generals-in-chief: he had no exact knowledge of the military
situation in each of their spheres of command, nor was he better
informed as to the strength, organization, and distribution of the
troops under their orders. Unable to use his new authority till he had
got together detailed statements as to these data, he directed his
chief-of-the-staff to ask for reports. Dorsenne replied that he should
not send any at present, because Berthier, when announcing to him that
the Armies of the South, of Portugal, and of Aragon had been put under
the King’s orders, had informed him that the Emperor would let him know
in due course what was to be done with the Army of the North. Marshal
Suchet demonstrated that he had received special instructions from the
Emperor, which presently were seen to make the King’s authority over
the Army of Aragon quite illusory. Soult had removed all the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> posts on the lines of
communication when he marched to relieve Badajoz, and showed so little
zeal in reopening them, that even in May it was not known at Madrid
whether he was yet aware that he was under the King’s orders. Marmont
was the only one who sent without delay the report which had been
asked for—but he announced at the same time that, in obedience to the
Emperor’s earlier orders, he was already operating beyond the Agueda,
to make a diversion for the relief of Badajoz<a id="FNanchor_342"
href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.’</p>

<p>Of what use was it to send orders to the marshals, when they
could plead that the execution of them was rendered impossible by
instructions received directly from the Emperor, which prescribed a
different policy? Unfortunately for King Joseph each commander-in-chief
still preserved his direct communication with the Minister of War at
Paris: even after the Emperor had started for Poland in May, each
continued to send in his own plans, and to demonstrate how far superior
they were to those prescribed by King Joseph. Soult, in particular,
generally commenced a dispatch by demonstrating that the directions
received from Madrid could not possibly be executed, and then produced
an elaborate scheme of his own, which would be beneficial for the Army
of Andalusia, but impracticable for those of Portugal, Valencia, and
the Centre. When his suggestions were rejected, he wrote privately to
Paris, declaring that Joseph and Jourdan were absolutely incapable,
and sometimes adding that the King was trying to serve his private
interests rather than those of his brother and suzerain. It was the
accidental receipt by Joseph of an intercepted letter of Soult’s to
the Minister of War, in which he was accused of absolute treason to
the Emperor, that brought about the final rupture between the King
and the Marshal, and led to the recall of the latter to France<a
id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.</p>

<p>King Joseph, though liable to fits of depression and despair,
was, on the whole, of a mercurial and self-sufficient temperament.
A few weeks before the receipt of the Emperor’s dispatch<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span> granting him the command
of the Spanish armies, all his letters had been full of complaints and
threats of abdication. But the decree of March 16th filled him with a
sudden confidence—at last his military talents should be displayed and
recognized; he would, as his brother desired, ‘make the marshals obey
him;’ for the future the armies should all act together for a single
end, and not be guided by the selfish interests of their leaders. He
accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief with undisguised pleasure,
and proceeded to draw out schemes of his own, with Jourdan as his
adviser in technical matters of military logistics.</p>

<p id="Mem">It cannot be denied that the ‘<i>Mémoire</i> of May 1812<a
id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>,’
in which Jourdan set forth the situation after the fall of Badajoz,
and the policy which he considered that it demanded, is a document of
much greater merit than might have been expected. It is by far the
best summary of the position of the French power in Spain that was
ever drawn up, and it recognizes with great clearness the two main
limitations of that power, which were (1) that the imperial troops
were an army of occupation rather than a genuine field army, and (2)
that the Napoleonic system, by which hosts were supposed to ‘live
on the countryside,’ might be applicable for a short campaign in
Lombardy or Bavaria, but was impossible for protracted manœuvres in an
exhausted and thinly-peopled land like central Spain. Jourdan’s note
on the <i>Mémoire</i> sums up the situation in a few lines—’Two measures
were indispensable: one was to render the army mobile, by giving it
ample transport, and by establishing large magazines on all lines of
communication: without these all permanent concentration of heavy
forces, and all continuous operations were impossible. The second was
to abandon the deplorable system of occupying as much territory as
possible—of which the real object was double: firstly, to enable the
armies to live on the country-side; secondly, to appear in the eyes of
Europe to be dominant over the whole of Spain.’</p>

<p>The <i>Mémoire</i> itself is worth analysing. Its gist runs as
follows:—</p>

<p>‘(1) The recent departure of the Imperial Guards, the Poles,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span> and other troops, and
the lack of any adequate system of transport or magazines, renders the
Imperial Army—though still 230,000 men strong—incapable of undertaking
any offensive operations. The present situation is exceptionally
trying, because of the successes of Wellington, and the deplorable
effect on Spanish public opinion of the recent annexation [Catalonia],
the arbitrary government of the generals, and the famine which has
lately prevailed. The discontent thereby engendered has led to the
enormous increase in the number of the guerrillero bands. It has also
encouraged the government at Cadiz to multiply its levies and its
military energy.</p>

<p>(2) It is not yet certain whether the Emperor intends the Army of
the North to be at the King’s disposal. General Dorsenne refuses to
send in reports or to accept orders. But since its recent reduction in
numbers [by the departure of the Imperial Guard, and the transfer of
Souham’s and Bonnet’s divisions to the Army of Portugal] it is believed
that it has not more than 48,000 men under arms, and it appears to be a
fact that it can do no more than hold down the wide regions committed
to its charge, and guard the line of communications with France. Even
if placed at the King’s disposition, it can furnish no important
reinforcements to other armies. Nevertheless it should be put under his
control, as it might under certain circumstances be called upon to lend
a moderate force for a short time.</p>

<p>(3) As to the Army of Aragon [60,000 men, including the divisions
in Catalonia]: the King was informed that Marshal Suchet was placed
under his command, and that if he needed reinforcements he might draw
on the troops in Valencia. He therefore [during the siege of Badajoz]
ordered the Marshal to send a division to join the Army of the Centre
for an indispensable operation<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345"
class="fnanchor">[345]</a>. The Marshal sent a formal declaration in
reply, to the effect that he could not execute this order, and that
he was even about to withdraw from Cuenca the regiment that he had
placed there, as its absence imperilled the safety of Valencia. He
says that the Emperor has placed Catalonia under his charge, and that
he is authorized to employ his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p.
305]</span> whole force for the protection of the provinces entrusted
to him. Apparently, then, the Army of Aragon cannot co-operate
in operations outside its own sphere, and the Marshal’s special
instructions place him in an exceptional position. His relations with
the King consist in a polite exchange of views, not in the giving
and taking of orders—his Majesty’s control over this army is purely
illusory.</p>

<p>(4) As to the Army of the South, Marshal Soult has about 54,000 men
effective [not including <i>Juramentados</i>, &amp;c.]. The Cadiz Lines and
the garrisons pin down a large force to fixed stations. The Marshal has
also to keep a considerable flying column in hand, to hunt Ballasteros
and other partisans. For operations outside the bounds of Andalusia he
can only collect a field-force of 24,000 men; this is the total figure
of the corps that tried to relieve Badajoz, and in its absence Seville
was nearly lost. The posts in the Sierra Morena were called in at that
time, and have never come back: correspondence with the Army of the
South is therefore precarious and slow.</p>

<p>(5) The Army of Portugal has 52,000 men effective. It holds the
front line against Wellington; its divisions are much scattered,
because it has to live on the country, and has also to furnish several
important garrisons. One division of 6,000 men is fixed down in the
Asturias by the Emperor’s special orders. The garrisons of Astorga,
Valladolid, Salamanca, Leon, Palencia, &amp;c., absorb 6,000 or 7,000
men more. Only 29,000 infantry [or a total of 35,000 of all arms] are
available as a field-force to use against the English, if they attack
on the front of the Tormes. If Marshal Marmont has to march out of
his own sphere, to join in a combined operation against Wellington
[e. g. in Estremadura], he can bring a still smaller force—say 25,000
men. The Army of Portugal is many months in arrear of its pay, and has
hardly any transport or magazines: the troops have become terrible
marauders—largely from necessity.</p>

<p>(6) Lastly we come to the Army of the Centre. It consists of 9,500
men borne on the Imperial muster-rolls, and 5,800 troops belonging
to the King [his Guards and Hugo’s <i>Juramentados</i>, horse and foot].
There are also at present in Madrid 3,200 drafts for the Army of
the South, temporarily retained—so that the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span> whole makes up 18,500 men. But only
15,000 are effective, the remainder consisting of dépôts, dismounted
cavalry, train, &amp;c. Having to hold down the extensive provinces
of Madrid, Segovia, Guadalajara, Toledo, La Mancha, and Cuenca, this
force is a mere “army of occupation.” It can provide no troops for
expeditions outside its own territory, and is spread so thin that even
Madrid would be in danger without the Royal Guards. The pay is eight
months in arrear.</p>

<p>(7) Civil administration is still localized: the commanders of the
armies levy their own taxes, and nothing comes to Madrid. The King has
to feed the Army of the Centre, and to maintain his civil service,
from the revenues of New Castile alone. None of the marshals will help
another with money or stores. The claim of the King to rule all Spain
seems absurd to the people, so long as he cannot exercise any civil
control outside the <i>arrondissement</i> of the Army of the Centre.</p>

<p>(8) Conclusion. All offensive operations are impossible, as long
as the imperial armies have to hold down the entirety of the occupied
provinces. If Lord Wellington concentrates all his forces, he can march
with 60,000 men [not including Spaniards] against either the Army of
Portugal or the Army of the South. Neither of them can assemble a
sufficient force to resist him, unless they abandon whole provinces.
The King has ordered Soult and Marmont to march to each other’s aid if
either is attacked. But they have to unite, coming from remote bases,
while the enemy can place himself between them and strike at one or the
other. The lines of communication between them are long and circuitous.
It is easily conceivable that one of them may be attacked and beaten
before the other is even aware of the danger. A catastrophe is quite
possible if Lord Wellington should throw himself suddenly, with his
whole force, upon either the Army of Portugal or that of the South.</p>

<p>The only possible way of dealing with this danger is to collect
a central reserve of 20,000 men at Madrid, which can be promptly
transferred to right or left, to join either Soult or Marmont as
the conditions of the moment dictate. The Army of the Centre cannot
serve this purpose—it is not a field-force, but an immovable army of
occupation. If the Emperor could send a new corps of this size from
France, Marmont could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p.
307]</span> reinforced up to a strength sufficient to enable him to
face Wellington, and to besiege Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>But the present posture of European affairs [the Russian war]
probably makes it impossible to draw such a corps from France. This
being so, the central reserve must be obtained from troops already
existing in the Peninsula. The only way to find them is for the Emperor
to consent to the evacuation of Andalusia. Thirty thousand men of the
Army of the South can then be placed to cover Madrid, in La Mancha:
this force would be ample against any Spanish levies that might come
up to the Sierra Morena from Cadiz and elsewhere. The remainder of
the Army of the South must form the central reserve, and prepare to
reinforce Marmont. The Army of Portugal would then be so strong that
Wellington could not dare to take the offensive—he would be hopelessly
outnumbered. If this scheme is approved by the Emperor, he may be
certain that, when he comes back from Poland, his Spanish armies will
be in the same secure defensive position in which he leaves them now.
The right wing rests on the Bay of Biscay in the Asturias: the left on
the Mediterranean in Valencia.</p>

<p>When Andalusia is evacuated, the remaining provinces in French
occupation will not be able to pay or feed the 54,000 men of the Army
of the South, in addition to the armies already stationed in them; a
liberal subsidy from Paris will be necessary. In addition the King
must, for the sake of his prestige, be given real civil authority over
all the provinces.</p>

<p>It will only be when all authority, civil, military, and
administrative, is concentrated in one hand, that of the King, and when
His Majesty shall have received from the Emperor instructions suiting
the present posture of affairs, that he can be fully responsible for
Spain.’</p>

<p>On the whole this is a very well-reasoned document. It was perfectly
true that the offensive power of the French in the Peninsula had shrunk
to nothing, because no province could be held down without a large
garrison. If left unoccupied, it would burst into revolt and raise an
army. This was the inevitable nemesis for a war of annexation directed
against a proud and patriotic people. There were 230,000 French troops
in Spain; but so many of them were tied down to occupation<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span> duty, that only about
50,000 or 60,000 could be collected to curb Wellington, unless some
large province were evacuated. Either Andalusia or else Valencia must
be abandoned. The former was the larger and the more wealthy; but it
was more remote from the strategical centre of operations in Madrid,
much more infested by the bands of the patriots, and it lay close to
the sphere of operations of Wellington—the great disturbing element
in French calculations. Moreover its evacuation would set free a much
larger field army. Against this was to be set the adverse balance in
loss of prestige: as long as Cadiz appeared to be beleaguered, the
national government of Spain looked like a handful of refugees in a
forlorn island. To abandon the immense lines in front of it, with
their dependent flotilla (which must be burnt, since it could not be
removed), would be a conclusive proof to all Europe that the main
frontal offensive against the Spanish patriots had failed. Seville
and Granada, great towns of world-wide fame, would also have to be
abandoned. Andalusia was full of <i>Afrancesados</i>, who must either be
shepherded to Madrid, or left to the vengeance of their countrymen.</p>

<p>But to weigh prestige against solid military advantage, though it
might appeal to Napoleon—whose reputation as universal conqueror was
part of his political stock-in-trade—did not occur to the common-sense
intellect of Jourdan. He voted for the evacuation of Andalusia: so did
his friend and master, King Joseph. Possibly their decision was not
rendered more unwelcome by the fact that it would certainly be most
distasteful to Soult, whom they both cordially detested. The Viceroy
should pay at last for the selfish policy of the General: his realm,
for the last two years, had been administered with much profit and
glory to himself, but with little advantage to the King at Madrid, or
the general prosperity of the French cause in Spain. Whether personal
motives entered into the decision of Joseph and Jourdan we need not
trouble to consider: it was certainly the correct one to take.</p>

<p>Permission to evacuate Andalusia was therefore demanded from
the Emperor: King Joseph did not dare to authorize it on his own
responsibility. Meanwhile, long before the <i>Mémoire</i> of May 1812 had
been completed or sent off, to Napoleon, he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span> issued the orders which he thought
himself justified in giving in the interim, to act as a stop-gap till
the permission should be granted. Marmont was told to fall back on his
own old policy of keeping a large detachment in the Tagus valley, in
order that he might get into touch with Drouet and Soult’s Estremaduran
corps of observation. He was directed to send two divisions of infantry
and a brigade of light cavalry to join Foy, who was still in the
direction of Almaraz and Talavera. They were to be ready to act as the
advance of the Army of Portugal for a march on Truxillo and Merida,
if Wellington’s next move should turn out to be an attack on Soult in
Andalusia. In a corresponding fashion, Soult was ordered to reinforce
Drouet up to a force of 20,000 men, and to push him forward to his old
position about Almendralejo, Zalamea, Merida, and Medellin, in order
that he might march via Truxillo to join the Army of Portugal, in
case the Anglo-Portuguese army should choose Salamanca, not Seville,
as its next objective. The small part of the Army of the Centre that
could be formed into a field-force—three battalions and two cavalry
regiments, under General d’Armagnac—was directed to move to Talavera,
to relieve Foy there if he should be called to move either north to
join Marmont on the Tormes, or south to join Soult on the Guadiana<a
id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>. To
replace these troops, drawn from the provinces of Cuenca and La Mancha,
Joseph—as we have already seen<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347"
class="fnanchor">[347]</a>—requested Suchet to send ‘a good division’
from Valencia by Cuenca, on to Ocaña in La Mancha<a id="FNanchor_348"
href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. In this way the King
and Jourdan thought they would provide for active co-operation between
the Armies of Portugal and Andalusia, whether Wellington should make
his next move to the South or the North.</p>

<p>It is curious, but perhaps not surprising, to find that
these orders, the first-fruits of Joseph’s new commission as
Commander-in-Chief, were obeyed neither by Suchet, by Soult, nor by
Marmont.</p>

<p>The former, as we have already seen, when analysing Jourdan’s
<i>Mémoire</i> of May 1812, not only refused to send a division<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span> to Ocaña, but stated that
he should be obliged to withdraw the regiment that he was keeping at
Cuenca, because he was authorized by the Emperor to reserve all his
own troops for the defence of his own sphere of action, in Valencia,
Aragon, and Catalonia. Soult declared that it was impossible for him
to reinforce Drouet—‘he could not keep 20,000 men on the Guadiana
unless he received large reinforcements: all that he could promise
was that the force in Estremadura should move up again to Medellin
and Villafranca, possibly even to Merida, if Wellington had really
gone northward with his main army. Drouet, with his 10,000 or 12,000
men, might serve to “contain” Hill and the British detachment in
Estremadura, and his position would prevent the enemy from making any
important movement in the valley of the Tagus. Meanwhile he himself
must, as an absolute necessity, lay siege to Tarifa for the second
time, and make an end of Ballasteros: no more troops, therefore, could
be sent to Drouet: but when Tarifa and Ballasteros had been finished
off, the siege of Cadiz should be pressed with vigour.’ This reply
is not only a blank refusal to obey the King’s orders, but amounts
to a definite statement that the local affairs of Andalusia are more
important than the general co-operation of the French armies in Spain.
As we shall presently see, Soult was ready to formulate this startling
thesis in the plainest terms—he was, ere long, to propose that the
King and the Army of the Centre should evacuate Madrid and retire upon
Andalusia, when things went wrong with the Army of Portugal.</p>

<p>As to Marmont, his reply to King Joseph’s dispatch was couched in
terms of less open disobedience, but it was by no means satisfactory.
He wrote from Salamanca, on April 29th, after his return from the
raid to Sabugal and Guarda, that he had now learnt (what he did not
know ten days before), that Wellington had been pursuing him with
five divisions. This force was still in the Beira, and the British
general himself had been at Ciudad Rodrigo on the 26th. It was,
therefore, quite clear that Soult had not ‘the whole English army on
his shoulders.’ This being so, it was not necessary to send into the
valley of the Tagus such a large force as was asked. But one division
should move to Avila at once, and could drop down<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span> on to Talavera in two days, if it turned
out to be necessary. Two more should be cantoned about Arevalo and
the Pass of Piedrahita [20 miles north-west of Avila] respectively,
points from which they could be transferred to the valley of the
Tagus in a few days. Marmont then proceeded to warn Jourdan against
any scheme for concentrating any considerable force in the direction
of La Mancha, urging that he must be able to collect as many of his
divisions opposite Wellington as possible, in case of an advance by the
Anglo-Portuguese army towards the Tormes. All that was necessary on the
Tagus was to have the forts at Almaraz well garrisoned and provided
with stores, so that troops dropping down from Avila on a southward
march should find a base and magazines ready for them. Summing up, he
ends with a dictum that ‘if we defend Andalusia by sacrificing the Army
of Portugal, we may save that province for the moment, but the North
will be in danger: if a disaster occurs there, Andalusia will soon
be lost also. If, on the contrary, we make its defence in the North,
the South may be lost, but the North still remains secure.’ By these
somewhat cryptic words, Marmont seems to mean that, looking at the
affairs of Spain at large, Andalusia may be lost without any shock to
the imperial domination in Leon and Old Castile. But a disaster in Leon
or Old Castile entails inevitably the loss of Andalusia also. This was
true enough, though Soult refused to see it.</p>

<p>But the result of Marmont’s very partial fulfilment of Joseph’s
orders, and of Soult’s and Suchet’s entire neglect of them, was that
Jourdan’s main design of providing for close and speedy co-operation
between the Armies of Portugal and Andalusia was completely foiled.
When, on May 17th-19th, Hill made his celebrated irruption into the
valley of the Tagus, with the object of destroying the bridge and forts
of Almaraz, the point where the interests of Soult and Marmont were
linked together, he found no French troops within fifty miles of his
objective, save the single division of Foy and D’Armagnac’s 3,000 men
from the Army of the Centre. Marmont’s nearest division in support
was at Avila, Soult’s in the Sierra Morena; both lay so far off from
Almaraz that Hill could not only deliver his blow, but could depart at
leisure when it was struck, without any risk of being beset by superior
forces. If King Joseph’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p.
312]</span> orders of April had been carried out, Wellington’s stroke
in May would have been impossible—or risky to the verge of rashness.
Indeed we may be certain, on Wellington’s record, that he would not
have made it, if three French divisions, instead of one, had been
about Talavera and Almaraz. We may add that his self-reliance during
the Salamanca campaign rested largely on the fact that Soult could
not succour Marmont, within any reasonable space of time, even if he
wished to do so, because the bridge of Almaraz was broken. Wherefore
Jourdan and King Joseph must be pronounced to have been wise in their
foresight, and the Dukes of Ragusa and Dalmatia highly blameworthy for
their disregard of the orders given them. They looked each to their own
local interests, not to the general strategic necessities of the French
position in Spain, which the King and his Chief-of-the-Staff were
keeping in mind.</p>

<p>So far their precautions were wise: to blame them for not taking the
tremendous step of evacuating Andalusia without the Emperor’s leave,
and concentrating such a force in central Spain as would have paralysed
Wellington’s offensive, would be unjust. They dared not have given such
an order—and if they had, Soult would have disobeyed it.</p>

<p>Napoleon himself, indeed, would have agreed with Soult at this time.
For not long after Jourdan’s <i>Mémoire</i> of May 1812, with its request
for leave to abandon Andalusia, had started on its journey for Dresden,
there arrived at Madrid a dispatch from Berthier, setting forth the
final instructions left by the Emperor before he started from Paris
on May 9th. It was of a nature to strike dismay into the heart of the
level-headed and rather despondent Jourdan; for it ignored all the
difficulties which his recently dispatched appeal set forth with such
clearness. The King was directed to keep a grip on all the conquered
provinces of Spain, and to extend their limits till the enemy should
be extirpated. The conquest of Portugal might be postponed till ‘les
événements détermineraient absolument cette mesure.’ The region to
which the Emperor devoted most attention was the sphere of the Army
of the North. ‘This is the part on which it is indispensable to keep
a firm hold, never to allow the enemy to establish himself there, or
to threaten the line of communications. Wherefore a most active war
must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span> waged
upon the “Brigands” [Mina, Porlier, Longa, &amp;c.]: it is of no use
to hunt and scatter them, leaving them power to reunite and to renew
their incursions. As to the English, the present situation seems
rather to require a defensive posture: but it is necessary to maintain
an imposing attitude in face of them, so that they may not take any
advantage of our position. The strength of the forces at the King’s
disposition enables him to do, in this respect, all that circumstances
may demand. Such are the principal ideas which the Emperor, before
departing, has expressed on the Spanish problem.’</p>

<p>This was a heart-breaking document. Just when the King and Jourdan
had demonstrated that they had no available field army left to hold
back Wellington, they were informed that their forces were ample for
the purpose. When they had asked leave to evacuate Andalusia they are
told to ‘conserver les conquêtes et les étendre successivement.’ They
had been wishing to concentrate at all costs a central reserve—now they
were directed to spread the already scattered army of occupation over
a still greater surface—presumably the Emperor’s phrase meant that he
wished to see Murcia, the Catalonian inland, the whole of the Asturias,
and the Condado de Niebla garrisoned, in addition to all that was held
already. The one central problem to Joseph and Jourdan was how to face
Wellington’s expected onslaught by making the armies co-operate—the
Emperor forbids concentration, and recommends ‘the assumption of an
imposing attitude!’ As if Wellington, whose knowledge of the movements
and plans of his adversaries was beginning to appear almost uncanny to
them, was to be contained by ‘attitudes,’ imposing or otherwise.</p>

<p>The unhappy Commander-in-Chief and Chief-of-the-Staff of the united
armies of Spain were reduced to a sort of apathetic despair by the
Emperor’s memorandum. Jourdan, in his <i>Mémoires</i>, appears to shrug
the shoulders of resignation in commenting on its effect. ‘If only
instead of “hold all you have, and conquer the rest bit by bit,” we had
been told that we might evacuate some provinces and concentrate the
troops, there would have been much good in the instructions. The King
might have dared to abandon the South in order to keep down the North,
if he had not received this dispatch. But he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> could not take that portentous step
without the imperial permission. All that he could now do, was to
reiterate his directions to Soult and Marmont that they must so place
their troops as to be able to succour each other. We shall see how
they obeyed those orders<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349"
class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.’</p>

<p>So, by the special and deliberate directions of the Emperor, the
230,000 effective men ‘present under arms,’ forming the five imperial
armies of Spain, were placed at the mercy of Lord Wellington and his
modest force of eight divisions of Anglo-Portuguese. In a flight of
angry rhetoric, Berthier, writing under Napoleon’s dictation, had once
asked whether it was reasonable ‘<i>que quarante mille Anglais gâtent
toutes les affaires d’Espagne</i>.’ The reply of the fates was to be that
such a contingency was perfectly possible, under the system which the
Emperor had instituted, and with the directions which he persisted in
giving.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER II">SECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER II</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE BRIDGE OF ALMARAZ. MAY 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On April</span> 24th Wellington halted his
pursuing army at Fuente Guinaldo and Sabugal, on hearing that Marmont
had escaped him by a margin of twenty-four hours. The French were in
full march for Salamanca, and it was impossible to pursue them any
further, firstly because the allied army needed a few days of rest
after the forced march from Badajoz, and secondly because its train had
dropped behind, food was nearly out, and convoys had to be brought up
from Lamego and São João de Pesqueira. There was, of course, nothing
to be got out of the unhappy region in which Marmont’s locusts had
just been spread abroad. The only fortunate thing was that the Duke of
Ragusa had turned his raid against the Beira Baixa, and left the great
dépôts on the Douro unmolested. From them ample sustenance could be got
up, in a week, to the positions behind the Agueda and Coa where the
army had halted.</p>

<p>Wellington, as it will be remembered, had contemplated an attack
on Andalusia after Badajoz fell. But the necessity for seeing to the
relief and revictualling of Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo had brought
him up to the frontiers of Leon with the main body of his host. In
the position where he now lay, he was well placed for an advance
on Salamanca, and an attack on the Army of Portugal. To return to
Estremadura would involve a long and weary countermarch. Moreover
there was no doubt that operations in Leon would be more decisive than
operations in Andalusia. As Marmont was to write to Berthier a few
days later, a victory of the allies in the North would involve the
evacuation of the South by Soult, while a victory in Andalusia would
leave the French power in the valleys of the Douro and Tagus unshaken<a
id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.
Advancing from the line of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p.
316]</span> Agueda against Salamanca and Valladolid, Wellington would
have his base and his main line of communications in his direct rear,
safe against any flank attack. A raid against Andalusia, even if
successful, would separate him from Lisbon, and compel him to take up
a new base at Cadiz—a doubtful expedient. But what seems, in the end,
to have been the main cause for Wellington’s choosing Leon rather than
Andalusia as his next sphere of operations, was that Marmont (as he
judged) had the larger available army for field movements outside his
own ground. Soult was more pinned down to his viceroyalty by local
needs: he would not raise the siege of Cadiz or evacuate Granada and
Cordova. Therefore he could not collect (as his movement at the time of
the fall of Badajoz had shown) more than 24,000 men for an offensive
operation. This was the absolute limit of his power to aid Marmont.
But the latter, if he chose to evacuate Asturias and other outlying
regions, could bring a much larger force to help Soult. Therefore
an attack on Andalusia would enable the enemy to concentrate a more
numerous defensive force than an attack on Leon. ‘Of the two armies
opposed to us that of Portugal can produce the larger number of men
for a distant operation. Marmont has nothing to attend to but the
British army, as he has been repeatedly told in [intercepted] letters
from Berthier. By abandoning Castille and Leon for a short time he
may lose some plunder and contributions, but he loses nothing that
can permanently affect his situation, or which he could not regain as
soon as he has a superiority, particularly of cavalry, in the open
plains of Castille. Marmont’s, then, being what may be called of
the two the <i>operating</i> army, the movement which I might make into
Andalusia would enable the enemy to bring the largest body of men to
act together on one point. It would be a false movement, and this
must by all means be avoided<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351"
class="fnanchor">[351]</a>.’</p>

<p>This decision was not made immediately on Marmont’s retreat of April
24th: for some days after the British headquarters settled down at
Fuente Guinaldo, Wellington had not quite made up his mind between the
two operations: his letters to Lord Liverpool, to Hill, and Graham,
are full of the needs of the moment, and do not lay down any general
strategical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span>
plan. The staff, in their discussions with each other, canvassed the
situation. ‘While Marmont remains in Old Castile he [Wellington] must
leave a certain force near the frontier of the Beira. But leaving
the 3rd, 4th, 5th Divisions, and Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese
(perhaps 18,000 men) for that purpose, he can move upon Andalusia, if
he wishes, with the 1st, 6th, 7th, and Light Divisions, afterwards
picking up Power’s Portuguese brigade and all General Hill’s <i>corps
d’armée</i>—perhaps 36,000 infantry. This would do.’ So wrote D’Urban
the chief of the Portuguese staff in his private diary, on May 5,
evidently after discussion with Beresford, and others of those who were
nearest the centre of decision. Wellington, however, was pondering over
alternatives: he could not move for a week or two at the best, for he
had to replenish his stores at the front, and to see that the repairs
and revictualling of Almeida and Rodrigo were completed, before he
could start on any offensive movement. In that time, too, he would be
able to learn how Marmont was disposing of his army, and whether Soult
was showing any tendency to reinforce Drouet’s force in Estremadura.</p>

<p>It seems that an insight into his enemies’ purposes was made
specially easy for Wellington at this moment by the successive capture
of a great deal of French correspondence. When Marmont was in Portugal,
between the 1st and 23rd of April, three of the duplicates of his
dispatches were captured, one by Portuguese Ordenança, the others
by Julian Sanchez between Rodrigo and Salamanca<a id="FNanchor_352"
href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. They were all in
cipher, but the ingenuity of Captain Scovell, the cipher-secretary at
head-quarters, was capable of dealing with them, and from them could
be made out a great deal about the strength of the Marshal’s army, and
his general views on the campaign. If they had been taken and sent
in a little earlier, they might have enabled Wellington to complete
that surprise and dispersion of the French expeditionary force which
had been in his mind.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p.
318]</span></p> <p>But though they arrived too late for this purpose,
they were valuable, as showing Marmont’s dislike of the imperial orders
that he had been sent to carry out, and his preference for his own
schemes. They were also full of bitter complaints of the neglect in
which the Army of Portugal was left as to pay, stores, and transport.
Wellington might reasonably deduce from them that any reconcentration
of that army would be slow, and that if it had to march to reinforce
Soult in the South, the effort would be a severe one.</p>

<p>But shortly after Marmont’s return to Salamanca, his adversary
got an even more valuable insight into his plans. The guerrilleros
carried off, between Salamanca and Valladolid, an officer bearing
five dispatches, dated April 28 and April 30th. One was directed
to Dorsenne, two to Berthier, one to Jourdan, the fifth contained
the parole to Bayonne of the great scout, Colquhoun Grant<a
id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>.
The first, couched in very peremptory terms, asked for food—the Army
of Portugal must absolutely receive 8,000 quintals of wheat, once
promised, without delay—it was in a state of danger and penury, and
could not keep concentrated to face the British. Of the letters to
Berthier one announced that Bonnet’s division was duly in march
for the Asturias, and that without it the Marshal thought his own
strength dangerously low. The other asked for 4,000,000 francs owing
to the Army of Portugal for pay and sustenance, and declared that,
unless money came to hand at once, it was impossible to see how the
troops were to be kept alive in the two months still remaining before
harvest. A postscript asked for a siege-train to be sent on at all
costs—the Marshal had heard that one was on the way from Bayonne:
but nothing was known about it at Burgos. The letter to Jourdan was
the most important of all<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354"
class="fnanchor">[354]</a>: it was the document, already quoted in
the previous chapter, in which the Marshal detailed his intentions
as to the dispersion of his army, protested against being obliged to
send too many men into the valley of the Tagus, and explained the
importance of the bridge-forts and magazines at Almaraz, by which his
troops at Avila, &amp;c., would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p.
319]</span> debouch southward whenever they were ordered to concentrate
for a junction with Soult. ‘On ne peut agir que par Lugar Nuevo [the
name by which Marmont always designates the Almaraz forts] ... il faut
bien se garder de jeter trop de troupes sur le Tage, et se contenter de
bien assurer une défense de huit jours pour les forts de Lugar Nuevo
et Mirabete, temps suffisant pour que les troupes rassemblées à Avila
débouchent.... Un dépôt de 400 à 500 mille fanegas (qui n’est pas au
delà de ce que Madrid et La Manche peuvent fournir) donnerait les
moyens d’agir sans compromettre la subsistance des troupes.’</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the deciphering of the greater part of this
letter, which set forth so clearly the importance of the Almaraz
bridge, and showed at the same time that only one French division
[Foy’s at Talavera] was anywhere near it, that determined Wellington
to make the sudden stroke at that central strategical point which he
had thought of in February<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355"
class="fnanchor">[355]</a>. At that time he had refused to try it,
because there were three French divisions on the Tagus. Now there
was only one at Talavera, two marches from Almaraz, and the nearest
reinforcements at Avila were two very long marches from Talavera. The
possibility presented itself that a column might strike at Almaraz
from somewhere on the Portuguese frontier, and take the place by a
<i>coup-de-main</i>, with or without first beating Foy, whose strength of
5,000 men was perfectly known to Wellington.</p>

<p>Hill could count on two or three days of undisturbed operations
before the nearest reinforcing division, that of Foy, could reach
Almaraz: on four or five more, before troops from Avila could come up.
It must be noted that everything would depend on the absolute secrecy
that could be preserved as to the start of the expedition: but on this
Wellington thought that he could count. The Spanish peasantry seldom
or never betrayed him: the French had no outlying posts beyond Almaraz
which might give them warning. The garrison was in a normal state of
blockade by guerrillero bands haunting the Sierra de Guadalupe.</p>

<p>It may be added that a blow at Almaraz was just as useful as a
means for keeping Soult from joining Marmont as Marmont from joining
Soult. It would be profitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p.
320]</span> if Wellington’s final decision should be given in favour
of an Andalusian expedition. But his mind was by now leaning towards
an attack on Leon rather than on the South. The final inclination may
have been given by the receipt of another intercepted dispatch—Soult’s
to Jourdan of April 17<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356"
class="fnanchor">[356]</a>, sent in by guerrilleros who had
probably captured the bearer in the Sierra Morena about April
20th. This document, which we have already had occasion to quote
for another purpose<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357"
class="fnanchor">[357]</a>, was full of angry denunciations of Marmont
for letting Badajoz fall unaided, and served to show that, if Soult
had to help the Army of Portugal, he would do so with no good will to
its commander. Moreover it was largely occupied by proposals for the
circumventing of Ballasteros and the siege of Tarifa—movements which
would disperse the Army of the South even more than it was already
dispersed, and would clearly prevent it from succouring Marmont within
any reasonable space of time.</p>

<p>The decision that Hill should make his long-deferred <i>coup-de-main</i>
upon Almaraz first appears in Wellington’s dispatches on May 4th<a
id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>,
but Hill had been warned that the operation was likely to be
sanctioned some days earlier, on April 24, and again more
definitely on April 30th<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359"
class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. That the final judgement of Wellington
was now leaning in favour of the advance on Salamanca rather than
the Andalusian raid appears to emerge from a note of D’Urban dated
May 6th—’The retirement of Marmont within a given distance—the slow
progress of the Spaniards at Rodrigo, which renders it unsafe to leave
that place and this frontier—the retiring altogether of Soult, and
the state of his army not making him dangerous now—these and other
combining reasons determine Lord Wellington to make his offensive
operation <i>north</i> of the Tagus, and to move upon Marmont. All necessary
preparations making, but secretly: it will be very feasible to keep
the movement unforeseen till it begins. Meanwhile General Hill is
to move upon and destroy everything at Almaraz<a id="FNanchor_360"
href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span>The orders
for Hill’s move were given out on May 7th. He was to march from his
head-quarters at Almendralejo with two British brigades (Howard’s and
Wilson’s) of the 2nd Division, and the Portuguese brigade attached to
the division (Ashworth’s), one British cavalry regiment (13th Light
Dragoons), and to cross the Guadiana at Merida. Beyond the Guadiana he
would pick up Campbell’s Portuguese cavalry brigade, which was lying at
Arroyo dos Molinos. The march was then to be as rapid as possible, via
Jaraicejo and Miravete. The expeditionary force made up 7,000 men in
all.</p>

<p>There were left in Estremadura to ‘contain’ Drouet the two
English cavalry brigades of Hill’s force (Slade’s and Long’s)<a
id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>,
one British infantry brigade (Byng’s) of the 2nd Division, Hamilton’s
Portuguese division, and Power’s unattached Portuguese brigade (late
the garrison of Elvas, and more recently acting as that of Badajoz).
The whole would make up 11,000 men. Power, or at least some of his
regiments, was now disposable, because the Spaniards destined to
hold Badajoz had begun to arrive, and more were daily expected<a
id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.</p>

<p>But this was not the only precaution taken against Drouet, who
had recently been reported as a little inclined to move northward
from Fuente Ovejuna—detachments of his cavalry had been seen as
far north as Zalamea<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363"
class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. Wellington determined to move down towards
the Guadiana the southern or right wing of his main army—the 1st
and 6th Divisions under Graham. First one and then the other were
filed across the bridge of Villa Velha and sent to Portalegre. Here
they would be in a position to support the force left in front of
Drouet, if Soult should unexpectedly reinforce his Estremaduran corps.
Wellington acknowledged that he disliked this wide extension of his
army, but justified himself by observing that, if he had now his left
wing almost touching the Douro, and his right wing almost touching
the Sierra Morena, he might risk the situation, because he was fully
informed as to Marmont’s similar dispersion. The Army of Portugal was
scattered from the Asturias to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p.
322]</span> Talavera, and from its want of magazines and transport,
which Marmont’s intercepted dispatches made evident, would be unable to
concentrate as quickly as he himself could.</p>

<p>The movement of Graham’s two divisions from the Castello Branco
region to south of the Tagus had an additional advantage. If reported
to the French it would tend to make them believe that the next
offensive operation of the allied army would be in the direction of
Andalusia, not towards the Tormes. If Soult heard of it, he would begin
to prepare to defend his own borders, and would not dream that Marmont
was really the enemy at whom Wellington was about to strike; while
Marmont, on the other hand, thinking that Soult was to be the object of
Wellington’s attentions, might be less careful of his own front. The
expedition to Almaraz would not undeceive either of them, since it was
well suited for a preliminary move in an attack on Andalusia, no less
than for one directed against Leon.</p>

<p>Hill’s column reached Merida on May 12th, but was delayed there
for some hours, because the bridge, broken in April, had not yet
been repaired, as had been expected, the officers sent there having
contented themselves with organizing a service of boats for the
passage. The bridge was hastily finished, but the troops only passed
late in the day; they picked up in the town the artillery and engineers
told off for the expedition, Glubb’s British and Arriaga’s Portuguese
companies of artillery, who brought with them six 24-pounder howitzers,
a pontoon train, and wagons carrying some 30-foot ladders for
escalading work. The importance attached to the raid by Wellington is
shown by the fact that he placed Alexander Dickson, his most trusted
artillery officer, in charge of this trifling detachment, which came up
by the road north of the Guadiana by Badajoz and Montijo to join the
main column.</p>

<p>Once over the Guadiana, Hill reached Truxillo in three rapid marches
[May 15], and there left all his baggage-train, save one mule for each
company with the camp-kettles. The most difficult part of the route
had now been reached, three successive mountain ranges separating
Truxillo from the Tagus. On the 16th, having crossed the first of
them, the column reached Jaraicejo: at dawn on the 17th, having made a
night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span> march, it was
nearing the Pass of Miravete, the last defile above the river. Here, as
Hill was aware, the French had outlying works, an old castle and two
small forts, on very commanding ground, overlooking the whole defile
in such a way that guns and wagons could not possibly pass them. The
British general’s original intention was to storm the Miravete works
at dawn, on the 17th, and at the same time to attack with a separate
column the forts at the bridge. With this purpose he divided his
troops into three detachments. Ashworth’s Portuguese and the artillery
were to keep to the <i>chaussée</i>, and make a demonstration of frontal
attack on the Castle: General Tilson-Chowne [interim commander of the
2nd Division at the moment<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364"
class="fnanchor">[364]</a>] was, with Wilson’s brigade and the 6th
Caçadores, to make a détour in the hills to the left and to endeavour
to storm the Castle from its rear side. General Howard, with the other
British brigade, was to follow a similar bridle path to the right, and
to descend on to the river and attack the forts by the bridge.</p>

<p>A miscalculation had been made—the by-paths which the flanking
columns were to take proved so far more steep and difficult than had
been expected, that by dawn neither of them had got anywhere near its
destination. Hill ordered them to halt, and put off the assault. This
was fortunate, for by a long and close reconnaissance in daylight it
was recognized that the Castle of Miravete and its dependent outworks,
Forts Colbert and Senarmont, were so placed on a precipitous conical
hill that they appeared impregnable save by regular siege operations,
for which the expeditionary force had no time to spare. The most
vexatious thing was that the garrison had discovered the main column
on the <i>chaussée</i>, and it could not be doubted that intelligence must
have been sent down to the lower forts, and most certainly to Foy
at Talavera also. After a thorough inspection of the ground, Hill
concluded that he could not hope to master Miravete, and, while it was
held against him, his guns could not get through the pass which it so
effectively commanded. It remained to be seen what could be done with
the forts at the bridge.</p>

<p>The Almaraz forts crowned two hills on each side of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> Tagus. The stronger,
Fort Napoleon, occupied the end of a long rising ground, about 100
yards from the water’s edge; below it, and connecting with it, was a
masonry <i>tête-de-pont</i> covering the end of the pontoon-bridge. The
weaker work, Fort Ragusa, was on an isolated knoll on the north bank,
supporting the other end of the bridge. Fort Napoleon mounted nine
guns, had a good but unpalisaded ditch around its bastioned front, and
a second retrenchment, well palisaded, with a loopholed stone tower
within. Fort Ragusa was an oblong earthwork mounting six guns, and also
provided with a central tower. It had as outwork a <i>flèche</i> or lunette,
commanding the north end of the bridge. The small <i>tête-de-pont</i>
mounted three guns more. Half a mile up-stream was the ruined masonry
bridge which had formed the old crossing, with the village of Almaraz
on the north bank behind it. Between the <i>tête-de-pont</i> and the old
bridge were the magazines and storehouses in the village of Lugar
Nuevo.</p>

<p>The garrison of the works consisted of a depleted foreign corps, the
<i>régiment de Prusse</i> or 4th Étranger, mustering under 400 bayonets, of
a battalion of the French 39th of the Line, and of two companies of
the 6th Léger, from Foy’s division, with a company of artillery and
another of sappers. The whole may have amounted to 1,000 men, of whom
300 were isolated in the high-lying Castle of Miravete, five miles from
the bridge-head. The governor, a Piedmontese officer named Aubert,
had manned Fort Napoleon with two companies of the 6th and 39th. The
foreign corps and one company of the 6th were in Fort Ragusa and the
bridge-head; Miravete was held by the centre companies of the 39th.</p>

<p>Though delay after the French had got the alarm was dangerous,
Hill spent the whole of the 17th in making fruitless explorations for
vantage-ground, from which Miravete might be attacked. None was found,
and on the 18th he made up his mind to adopt a scheme hazardous beyond
his original intention. It would be possible to mask the Castle by a
false attack, in which all his artillery should join, and to lead part
of his infantry over the hills to the right, by a gorge called the Pass
of La Cueva, for a direct attack by escalade, without the help of guns,
upon the Almaraz forts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span>The detachment
selected for this purpose was Howard’s brigade (1/50th, 1/71st,
1/92nd), strengthened by the 6th Portuguese Line from Ashworth’s
brigade, and accompanied by 20 artillerymen in charge of the ladders.
So rough was the ground to be covered, that the long 30-foot ladders
had to be sawn in two, being unwieldy on slopes and angles, as was
soon discovered when they were taken off the carts for carriage by
hand. The route that had to be followed was very circuitous, and
though the forts were only five miles, as the crow flies, from the
place where the column left the road, it took the whole night to
reach them. An eye-witness<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365"
class="fnanchor">[365]</a> describes it as a mazy sheep-walk among
high brushwood, which could not have been used without the help of
the experienced peasant-guide who led the march. The men had to pass
in Indian file over many of its stretches, and it resulted from long
walking in the darkness that the rear dropped far behind the van, and
nearly lost touch with it. Just before dawn the column reached the
hamlet of Romangordo, a mile from the forts, and rested there for some
time before resuming its march.</p>

<p>The sun was well up when, at 6 o’clock, the leading company, coming
to the edge of a thicket, suddenly saw Fort Napoleon only 300 yards
in their front. The French had been warned that a column had crossed
the hills, and had caught some glimpse of it, but had lost sight of
its latest move: many of the garrison could be seen standing on the
ramparts, and watching the puffs of smoke round the Castle of Miravete,
which showed that the false attack on that high-lying stronghold
had begun. General Tilson-Chowne was making a noisy demonstration
before it, using his artillery with much ostentation, and pushing
up skirmishers among the boulders on the sides of the castle-hill<a
id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p>Hill was anxious to assault at once, before the sun should rise
higher, or the garrison of the forts catch sight of him. But some time
had to be spent to allow a sufficient force to accumulate in the cover
where the head of the column was hiding. So<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span> slowly did the companies straggle in,
that the General at last resolved to escalade at once with the 50th
and the right wing of the 71st, all that had yet come up. Orders were
left behind that the left wing of the 71st and the 92nd should attack
the bridge-head entrenchment when they arrived, and the 6th Portuguese
support where they were needed.</p>

<p>At a little after 6 o’clock the 900 men available, in three columns
of a half-battalion each, headed by ladder parties, started up out
of the brake on the crest of the hillside nearest Fort Napoleon, and
raced for three separate points of its <i>enceinte</i>. The French, though
taken by surprise, had all their preparations ready, and a furious fire
broke out upon the stormers both from cannon and musketry. Nevertheless
all three parties reached the goal without any very overwhelming
losses, jumped into the ditch, and began to apply their ladders to
such points of the rampart as lay nearest to them. The assault was a
very daring one—the work was intact, the garrison adequate in numbers,
the assailants had no advantage from darkness, for the sun was well
up and every man was visible. All that was in their favour was the
suddenness of their onslaught, the number of separate points at which
it was launched, and their own splendid dash and decision. Many men
fell in the first few minutes, and there was a check when it was
discovered that the ladders were over-short, owing to their having been
sawn up before the start. But the rampart had a rather broad berm<a
id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>, a
fault of construction, and the stormers, discovering this, climbed up
on it, and dragging some of the ladders with them, relaid them against
the upper section of the defences, which they easily overtopped. By
this unexpected device a footing was established on the ramparts at
several points simultaneously—Captain Candler of the 50th is said to
have been the first man over the parapet: he was pierced by several
balls as he sprang down, and fell dead inside. The garrison had kept up
a furious fire till the moment when they saw the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span> assailants swarm over the parapet—then,
however, there can be no doubt that most of them flinched<a
id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>: the
governor tried to lead a counter-charge, but found few to follow him;
he was surrounded, and, refusing to surrender and striking at those
who bade him yield, was piked by a sergeant of the 50th and mortally
wounded. So closely were the British and French mixed that the latter
got no chance of manning the inner work, or the loopholed tower which
should have served as their rallying-point. Many of the garrison
threw down their arms, but the majority rushed out of the rear gate
of the fort towards the neighbouring redoubt at the bridge-head. They
were so closely followed that pursuers and pursued went in a mixed
mass into that work, whose gunners were unable to fire because their
balls would have gone straight into their own flying friends. The
foreign garrison of the <i>tête-de-pont</i> made little attempt to resist,
and fled over the bridge<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369"
class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. It is probable that the British would
have reached the other side along with them if the centre pontoons
had not been sunk: some say that they were struck by a round-shot
from Fort Ragusa, which had opened a fire upon the lost works; others
declare that some of the fugitives broke them, whether by design or
by mischance of overcrowding<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370"
class="fnanchor">[370]</a>.</p>

<p>This ought to have been the end of Hill’s sudden success, since
passage across the Tagus was now denied him. But the enemy were
panic-stricken; and when the guns of Fort Napoleon were trained
upon Fort Ragusa by Lieutenant Love and the twenty gunners who had
accompanied Hill’s column, the garrison evacuated it, and went off with
the rest of the fugitives in a disorderly flight towards Naval Moral.
The formidable works of Almaraz had fallen before the assault of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> 900 men—for the tail of
Hill’s column arrived on the scene to find all over<a id="FNanchor_371"
href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. Four grenadiers of
the 92nd, wishing to do something if they had been disappointed of the
expected day’s work, stripped, swam the river, and brought back several
boats which had been left moored under Fort Ragusa. By means of these
communication between the two banks was re-established, and the fort
beyond the river was occupied<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372"
class="fnanchor">[372]</a>.</p>

<p>The loss of the victors was very moderate—it fell mostly on the 50th
and 71st, for Chowne’s demonstration against Miravete had been almost
bloodless—only one ensign and one private of the 6th Caçadores were
wounded. But the 50th lost one captain and 26 men killed, and seven
officers and 93 men wounded, while the half-battalion of the 71st had
five killed and five officers and 47 men wounded<a id="FNanchor_373"
href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. The 92nd had two
wounded. Thus the total of casualties was 189.</p>

<p>Of the garrison the 4th Étranger was pretty well destroyed—those
who were neither killed nor taken mostly deserted, and its numbers had
gone down from 366 in the return of May 15 to 88 in that of July 1.
The companies of the 39th and 6th Léger also suffered heavily, since
they had furnished the whole of the unlucky garrison of Fort Napoleon.
Hill reports 17 officers and 262 men taken prisoners, including the
mortally wounded governor and a <i>chef de bataillon</i> of the 39th<a
id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. It
is probable that the whole loss of the French was at least 400.</p>

<p>The trophies taken consisted of a colour of the 4th Étranger, 18
guns mounted in the works, an immense store of powder and round-shot,
120,000 musket cartridges, the 20 large pontoons forming the bridge,
with a store of rope, timbers, anchors, carriages, &amp;c., kept for
its repair, some well-furnished workshops,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> and a large miscellaneous magazine of
food and other stores. All this was destroyed, the pontoons, &amp;c.,
being burnt, while the powder was used to lay many mines in the forts
and bridgehead, which were blown up very successfully on the morning
of the 20th, so that hardly a trace of them remained. Thiele of the
German artillery, the officer charged with carrying out the explosions,
was unfortunately killed by accident: a mine had apparently failed; he
went back to see to its match, but it blew up just as he was inspecting
it.</p>

    ALMARAZ
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">Having accomplished his purpose with complete success,
Hill moved off without delay, and by two forced marches reached
Truxillo and his baggage on the 21st. Here he was quite safe: Foy,
being too weak to pursue him to any effect, followed cautiously, and
only reached Miravete (whose garrison he relieved) on the 23rd and
Truxillo on the 25th, from whence he turned back, being altogether
too late. He had received news of Hill’s movement rather late on the
17th, had been misinformed as to his strength, which report made
15,000 men instead of the real 7,000, and so had been disposed to act
cautiously. He had ordered a battalion of the 6th Léger from Naval
Moral to join the garrison of Almaraz, but it arrived on the afternoon
of the 19th, only in time to hear from fugitives of the disaster<a
id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>. He
himself was confident that the forts could hold out eight days even
against artillery, which was also Marmont’s calculation. Hence their
fall within 48 hours of Hill’s appearance was a distressing surprise:
Foy had calculated on being helped not only by D’Armagnac from Talavera
but by the division of Clausel from Avila, before moving to fight Hill
and relieve them.</p>

<p>Wellington appears to have been under the impression that this
expedition, which Hill had executed with such admirable celerity and
dispatch, might have been made even more decisive, by the capture of
the castle of Miravete, if untoward circumstances had not intervened.
In a letter to Lord Liverpool, written on May 28<a id="FNanchor_376"
href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>, he expresses the
opinion that Tilson-Chowne might have taken it on the night of the
16th—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span> must
appear a hazardous decision to those who look at the precipitous
position of the place and the strength of its defences. He also says
that Hill might have stopped at Almaraz for a few days more, and have
bombarded Miravete with Dickson’s heavy howitzers, if he had not
received false news from Sir William Erskine as to Drouet’s movements
in Estremadura. There can be no doubt, as we shall see, about the false
intelligence: but whether the bombardment would have been successful is
another thing. Probably Wellington considered that the garrison would
have been demoralized after what had happened at Almaraz.</p>

<p>As to Drouet’s movements, having received rather tardy notice of
Hill’s northward march from Merida, he had resolved to make a push to
ascertain what was left in his front. Lallemand’s dragoons, therefore,
pressed out in the direction of Zafra, where they came into contact
with Slade’s outposts and drove them in. At the same time Drouet
himself, with an infantry division and some light cavalry, advanced
as far as Don Benito, near Medellin, on the 17th May, from whence he
pushed patrols across the Guadiana as far as Miajadas. This movement,
made to ascertain whether Hill had departed with his whole corps, or
whether a large force had been left in Estremadura, was reported to Sir
William Erskine, the commander of the 2nd cavalry division, along with
rumours that Soult was across the Sierra Morena and closely supporting
Drouet. Erskine sent on the news to Graham at Portalegre, and to Hill,
who was then before Miravete, with assertions that Soult was certainly
approaching. This, as Wellington knew, was unlikely, for the Marshal
had been before Cadiz on the 11th, and could not possibly have crossed
the Sierra Morena by the 17th. As a matter of fact he only learnt on
the 19th, at Chiclana, that Hill had started, and Drouet’s move was
made purely to gain information and on his own responsibility. But
Graham, naturally unaware of this, brought up his two divisions to
Badajoz, as he had been directed to do if Estremadura were attacked
during Hill’s absence. And Hill himself was certainly induced to return
promptly from Almaraz by Erskine’s letter, though it is doubtful
whether he would have lingered to besiege Miravete even if he had not
received it. For Foy might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p.
331]</span> been reinforced by D’Armagnac and the Avila division up
to a strength which would have made Hill’s longer stay on the Tagus
undesirable.</p>

<p>Drouet did no more; indeed, with his own force he was quite helpless
against Hill, since when he discovered that there was a large body
of allied troops left in Estremadura, and that more were coming up,
it would have been mad for him to move on Merida, or take any other
method of molesting the return of the expedition from Almaraz. Though
Soult spoke of coming with a division to his aid, the succours must be
many days on the way, while he himself could only act effectively by
marching northward at once. But if he had taken his own division he
would have been helpless against Hill, who could have beaten such a
force; while if he had crossed the Guadiana with his whole 12,000 men,
he would have been cut off from Soult by the ‘uncontained’ allied force
left in Estremadura, which he knew to be considerable.</p>

<p>But to move upon Almaraz on his own responsibility, and without
Soult’s orders, would have been beyond Drouet’s power: he was a man
under authority, who dared not take such a step. And when Soult’s
dispatches reached him, they directed him not to lose touch with
Andalusia, but to demonstrate enough to bring Hill back. The Marshal
did not intend to let Drouet get out of touch with him, by bidding him
march toward the Tagus.</p>

<p>Hill’s column, then, was never in any danger. But Wellington, who
had for a moment some anxiety in his behalf, was deeply vexed by
Erskine’s false intelligence, which had given rise to that feeling,
and wrote in wrath to Henry Wellesley and Graham<a id="FNanchor_377"
href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> concerning the mischief
that this very incapable officer had done. He was particularly
chagrined that Graham had been drawn down to Badajoz by the needless
alarm, as he was intending to bring him back to join the main army
within a short time, and the movement to Badajoz had removed him three
marches from Portalegre, so that six days in all would be wasted
in bringing him back to his original starting-point. It is curious
that Wellington did not harden his heart to get rid of Erskine<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> after this mishap: but
though he wrote bitterly about his subordinate’s incapacity, he did
not remove him. ‘Influence’ at home was apparently the key to his
long endurance: it will be remembered that this was by no means the
first of Erskine’s mistakes<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378"
class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.</p>

<p>The fall of the Almaraz forts, as might have been expected, was
interpreted by Marmont and Soult each from his own point of view.
The former, rightly as it turned out, wrote to Foy that he must be
prepared to return to Leon at short notice, and that the Army of the
Centre and Drouet must guard the valley of the Tagus on his departure<a
id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.
Soult, on the other hand, having heard of Graham’s arrival at Badajoz
and Hill’s return to Merida, argued that the allies were massing on
the Guadiana for an advance into Andalusia. He made bitter complaints
to Jourdan that he had violated the rules of military subordination by
sending a letter to Drouet warning him that he might be called up to
the Tagus. It was unheard of, he said, to communicate directly with
a subordinate, who ought to be written to only through the channel
of his immediate superior. He even threatened to resign the command
of the Army of the South<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a>—but when Joseph showed no signs of being
terrified by this menace, no more was heard of it. The viceroyalty of
Andalusia was not a thing to be lightly given up.</p>

<p>It soon became evident to Wellington that the surprise of Almaraz
was not to be resented by the enemy in any practical form. Foy was not
reinforced, nor was Drouet brought up to the Tagus: it was clear that
the French were too weak to take the offensive either in the North or
the South, even under such provocation. They could not even rebuild
the lost bridge: the transport from Madrid of a new pontoon train as a
substitute for the lost boats was beyond King Joseph’s power. One or
two boats were finally got to Almaraz—but nothing that could serve as a
bridge. Nor were the lost magazines ever replaced.</p>

<p>It was at this same time that Wellington took in hand a scheme for
facilitating his communications north and south, which was to have a
high strategical importance. As long as Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz
were in the enemy’s hands, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p.
333]</span> most eastern crossing of the Tagus practicable for the
Anglo-Portuguese army was the boat-bridge of Villa Velha. But when
these two fortresses were regained, it was possible to open up a
line farther east, which had not been available for two years. Since
Mayne blew up the ancient Roman bridge of Alcantara in June 1809<a
id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>, the
Middle Tagus had been impassable for both sides. The allies had usually
been in possession of both banks of the Tagus in this direction, but
so intermittently that it had never been worth their while to restore
the passage, which would have been lost to them whenever the French
(as not unfrequently happened) extended their operations into the
Coria-Zarza Mayor country on the north bank, or the Caçeres-Albuquerque
country on the other. But when the enemy had lost both Badajoz and
Rodrigo, and had no posts nearer to Alcantara than the Upper Tormes,
the forts of Miravete, and Zalamea, when, moreover, he had adopted a
distinctly defensive attitude for many months, Wellington thought it
worth while to recover possession of a passage which would shorten the
route from Estremadura to the frontiers of Leon by a hundred miles, and
would therefore give him an advantage of six marches over the enemy in
transferring troops from north to south. Whether Almaraz were again
seized and reoccupied by the French mattered little: the restoration of
Alcantara would be safe and profitable.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on May 24th, Colonel Sturgeon<a id="FNanchor_382"
href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> and Major Todd
of the Royal Staff Corps were sent to Alcantara to report on the
practicability of restoring the broken arch, which, owing to the
immense depth of the cañon of the Tagus, overhung the river by no
less than 140 feet. It was intended that if the engineering problem
should prove too hard, a flying bridge of rafts, boats, or pontoons
should be established at the water level<a id="FNanchor_383"
href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>. But Sturgeon and
Todd did more than Wellington had expected, and succeeded in a very
few days in establishing a sort of suspension-bridge of ropes between
the two shattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span>
piers of Trajan’s great structure. The system adopted was that of
placing at each end of the broken roadway a very large and solid beam,
clamped to the Roman stones, by being sunk in channels cut in them.
These beams being made absolutely adhesive to the original work, served
as solid bases from which a series of eighteen cables were stretched
over the gap. Eight more beams, with notches cut in them to receive
the cables, were laid at right angles across the parallel ropes, and
lashed tight to them. The long cables were strained taut with winches:
a network of rope yarn for a flooring was laid between the eight
beams, and on this planks were placed, while a screen of tarpaulins
supported on guide-ropes acted as parapets. The structure was sound
enough to carry not only infantry and horses, but heavy artillery,
yet could always be broken up in a short time if an enemy had ever
appeared in the neighbourhood<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a>. Several times it was rolled up, and then
replaced.</p>

<p>When the completion of the repairs of Alcantara and the destruction
of the French bridge of Almaraz are taken together, it must be
concluded that Wellington’s work in May gave him an advantage over the
French of at least ten or twelve marches in moving troops from north
to south or vice versa. For the route from Ciudad Rodrigo to Merida,
now open to him, had at least that superiority over the only itinerary
of the enemy, which would be that by Avila, Talavera, Toledo, and
the eastern passes of the Sierra Morena. Though the narrow bridge of
Arzobispo on the Middle Tagus still remained in French hands, it did
not lead on to any good road to Estremadura or Andalusia, but on to the
defiles of the Mesa d’Ibor and the ravines of the Sierra de Guadalupe.
No large force could march or feed in those solitudes.</p>

<p>All was now ready for the advance upon the Tormes, which Wellington
had made up his mind to execute.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER III">SECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER III</h3>
  <p class="subh3">WELLINGTON’S ADVANCE INTO LEON</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> not till June 13th that Wellington
crossed the Agueda and began his march upon Salamanca, the first great
offensive movement against the main fighting army of the French since
the advance to Talavera in 1809. But for many days beforehand his
troops were converging on Fuente Guinaldo and Ciudad Rodrigo from their
widely-spread cantonments. Graham’s divisions quitted Portalegre on May
30th, and some of the other troops, which had been left on the western
side of the Beira, had also to make an early start. Every available
infantry unit of the Anglo-Portuguese army had been drawn in, save
the 2nd Division and Hamilton’s Portuguese—left as usual with Hill in
Estremadura—and Power’s new Portuguese brigade—once the garrisons of
Elvas and Abrantes—which had become available for the field since the
fall of Badajoz made it possible to place those fortresses in charge of
militia. Its arrival made Hill stronger by 2,000 in infantry than he
had ever been before, and he was also left the three brigades (Long’s
and Slade’s British and John Campbell’s Portuguese) of Erskine’s
cavalry division. The total was 18,000 men. Wellington’s own main army,
consisting of the seven other infantry divisions, Pack’s and Bradford’s
Portuguese brigades, and the cavalry of Anson, Bock, Le Marchant,
and Victor Alten, made up a force of 48,000 men, of which 3,500 were
cavalry: there were only eight British and one Portuguese batteries
with the army—a short allowance of 54 guns.</p>

<p>But though these 48,000 men constituted the striking force, which
was to deal the great blow, their action was to be supported by a very
elaborate and complicated system of diversions, which were intended
to prevent the French armies of the South, North, Centre, and Aragon
from sending any help to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p.
336]</span> Marmont, the foe whom Wellington was set on demolishing. It
is necessary to explain the concentric scheme by which it was intended
that pressure should be brought to bear on all the outlying French
armies, at the same moment at which the Anglo-Portuguese main body
crossed the Agueda.</p>

<p>Soult had the largest force—over 50,000 men, as a recently
captured morning-state revealed to his adversary<a id="FNanchor_385"
href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. But he could not
assemble more than some 24,000 men, unless he abandoned the siege of
Cadiz and the kingdom of Granada—half his army was pinned down to
occupation-work. Wherefore Wellington judged that his field-force
could be ‘contained’ by Hill, if only means were found of preventing
him from reinforcing Drouet’s divisions in Estremadura by any
appreciable succours. This means lay to hand in the roving army of
Ballasteros, whose random schemes of campaign were often irrational,
but had the solitary advantage of being quite inscrutable. He might do
anything—and so was a most tiresome adversary for Soult to deal with,
since his actions could not be foreseen. At this moment Wellington had
urged the Cadiz Regency to stir up Ballasteros to activity, and had
promised that, if Soult concentrated against him, Hill should press
in upon Drouet, and so call off the Marshal’s attention. Similarly
if Soult concentrated against Hill, Ballasteros was to demonstrate
against Seville, or the rear of the Cadiz Lines. There was always the
possibility that the Spanish general might refuse to obey the orders of
his Government, or that he might commit himself to some rash enterprise
and get badly beaten. Both these chances had to be risked. The one that
occurred was that Ballasteros took up the idea desired, but acted too
early and too incautiously, and sustained a severe check at the battle
of Bornos (June 1). Fortunately he was ‘scotched but not slain,’ and
kept together a force large enough to give Soult much further trouble,
though he did not prevent the Marshal from sending reinforcements to
Drouet and putting Hill upon the defensive. Of this more in its due
place.</p>

<p>So much for the diversion against Soult. On the other flank
Wellington had prepared a similar plan for molesting the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span> French in the Asturias,
and threatening Marmont’s flank and rear, at the same moment that
his front was to be assailed. The force here available was Abadia’s
Army of Galicia, which nominally counted over 24,000 men, but had
6,000 of them shut up in the garrisons of Corunna, Ferrol, and Vigo.
About 16,000 could be put into the field by an effort, if only
Abadia were stirred up to activity. But there were many hindrances:
this general was (like most of his predecessors) at strife with the
Galician Junta. He was also very jealous of Sir Howard Douglas, the
British Commissioner at Corunna, who was in favour with the Junta
and people, and was inclined to resent any advice offered by him<a
id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>.
His army was not only (as in 1810-11) very short of cavalry—there
were only about 400 effective sabres—but also of artillery. For the
Cadiz government, searching for troops to send against the rebels of
South America, had recently drafted off several batteries, as well as
several foot regiments, to the New World. The most effective units had
been taken, to the wild indignation of the Galicians, who wanted to
keep the troops that they had raised for their own protection. There
were only about 500 trained artillerymen left in Galicia, and when
deduction was made for the garrisons of Ferrol, Vigo, and Corunna, very
few remained for the active army. Abadia had, therefore, many excuses
to offer for taking the field late, and with insufficient equipment<a
id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.
It was fortunate that his superior, Castaños, who commanded (as
Captain-General both of Estremadura and Galicia) all the troops in
western Spain, fell in completely with Wellington’s plan, and brought
pressure to bear upon his subordinate, coming up to Santiago in person
to expedite matters.</p>

<p>The part which the Army of Galicia was to play in the general scheme
was that of marching upon Astorga, and laying siege to the considerable
French garrison which was isolated in that rather advanced position. If
Marmont should attempt to succour it, he would be left weak in front
of the oncoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>
British invasion. If he did not, its fall would turn and expose his
right flank, and throw all the plains of northern Leon into the power
of the allies. A move in force upon Astorga would also have some effect
on the position of General Bonnet in the Asturias, and ought certainly
to keep him uneasy, if not to draw him away from his conquests.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Bonnet had been directed to reoccupy
the Asturias by Napoleon’s special command, and by no means
to Marmont’s liking<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388"
class="fnanchor">[388]</a>. He marched from Leon on May 15, by the
road across the pass of Pajares, which he had so often taken before on
similar expeditions. The Asturians made no serious resistance, and on
May 17-18 Bonnet seized Oviedo and its port of Gijon. But, as in 1811,
when he had accomplished this much, and planted some detachments in
the coast towns, his division of 6,000 men was mainly immobilized, and
became a string of garrisons rather than a field-force. It was observed
by Porlier’s Cantabrian bands on its right hand, and by Castañon’s
division of the Army of Galicia on its left, and was not strong enough
to hunt them down, though it could prevent them from showing themselves
anywhere in the neighbourhood of Oviedo.</p>

<p>But if the Galicians should lay siege to Astorga, and push advanced
guards beyond it, in the direction of the city of Leon, it was clear
that Bonnet’s position would be threatened, and his communications with
his chief, Marmont, imperilled. Wellington, who knew from intercepted
dispatches the importance attached by the Emperor to the retention of
the Asturias, judged that Bonnet would not evacuate it, but would spend
his energy in an attempt to hold back the Galicians and keep open his
connexion with Leon. He thus hoped that the French division at Oviedo
would never appear near Salamanca—an expectation in which he was to
be deceived, for Marmont (disregarding his master’s instructions)
ordered the evacuation of the Asturias the moment that he discovered
the strength of the attack that was being directed against his front
on the Tormes. Hence Wellington’s advance cleared the Asturias of
the enemy, and enabled the Galicians to besiege Astorga unmolested
for two months—good results in themselves, but<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> not the precise benefits that he had
hoped to secure by putting the Galician army in motion.</p>

<p>No item of assistance being too small to be taken into
consideration, Wellington also directed Silveira to advance from the
Tras-os-Montes, with the four militia regiments of that province<a
id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>,
to cross the Spanish frontier and blockade Zamora, the outlying
French garrison on the Douro, which covered Marmont’s flank, as
Astorga did his rear. To enable this not too trustworthy irregular
force to guard itself from sudden attacks, Wellington lent it a full
brigade of regular cavalry<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390"
class="fnanchor">[390]</a>, which was entrusted to General D’Urban, who
dropped the post of Chief-of-the-Staff to Beresford to take up this
small but responsible charge. His duty was to watch the country on each
side of the Douro in Silveira’s front, so as to prevent him from being
surprised, and generally to keep Wellington informed about Marmont’s
right wing, when he should begin to concentrate. Toro, only 20 miles
farther up the Douro than Zamora, was another French garrison, and a
likely place for the Marshal to use as one of his minor bases. Silveira
being as rash as he was enterprising, it was D’Urban’s task to see that
he should be warned betimes, and not allowed to get into trouble. He
was to retreat on Carvajales and the mountains beyond the Esla if he
were attacked by a superior force.</p>

<p>A much more serious diversion was prepared to distract the free
movement of the French Army of the North, from which Caffarelli
might naturally be expected to send heavy detachments for Marmont’s
assistance, when the British striking-force should advance on
Salamanca. Caffarelli’s old enemies were the patriot bands of Cantabria
and Navarre, who had given his predecessor, Dorsenne, so much trouble
earlier in the year. Mina, on the borders of Navarre, Aragon, and
Old Castile, was very far away, and not easy to communicate with or
to bring into the general plan, though his spirit was excellent.
But the so-called ‘Seventh Army,’ under Mendizabal, was near enough
to be treated as a serious factor in the general scheme. This force
consisted of the two large bands under Porlier in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> Cantabria, and Longa in the mountains
above Santander, each of which was several thousands strong: these
were supposed to be regular divisions, though their training left much
to be desired: in addition there were several considerable guerrilla
‘partidas’ under Merino, Salazar, Saornil, and other chiefs, who lived
a hunted life in the provinces of Burgos, Palencia, and Avila, and
were in theory more or less dependent on Mendizabal. The chief of the
Seventh Army was requested to do all that he could to keep Caffarelli
employed during the month of June—a task that quite fell in with his
ideas—he executed several very daring raids into Old Castile, one of
which put the garrison of Burgos in great terror, as it was surprised
at a moment when all its better items chanced to be absent, and nothing
was left in the place but dépôts and convalescents<a id="FNanchor_391"
href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>.</p>

<p>But the main distraction contrived to occupy the French Army of
the North was one for which Wellington was not primarily responsible,
though he approved of it when the scheme was laid before him. This
was a naval expedition to attack the coast-forts of Cantabria and
Biscay, and open up direct communication with Mendizabal’s bands
from the side of the sea. The idea was apparently started by Sir
Howard Douglas and Sir Home Popham, the former of whom was a great
believer in the <i>guerrilleros</i>, and the latter a strong advocate of
the striking power of the navy. Nothing serious had been done on the
Biscay coast since the two expeditions of 1810, of which the former
had been very successful, but the latter had ended in the disastrous
tempest which wrecked Renovales’s flotilla on that rocky shore<a
id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.
Lord Liverpool consented to give Popham two battalions of marines and
a company of artillery, to add to the force provided by the crews of
the <i>Venerable</i>, his flagship, five frigates (<i>Surveillante</i>, <i>Rhin</i>,
<i>Isis</i>, <i>Diadem</i>, <i>Medusa</i>), and several smaller vessels. The plan
was to proceed eastward along the coast from Gijon, to call down
Longa and Porlier to blockade each isolated French garrison from the
land side, and to batter it with heavy ship guns from the water. The
opportunity was to be taken at the same time of making over to the
Cantabrian bands a large store of muskets and munitions which had been
prepared for them. The arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p.
341]</span>ments were made in May, and Popham’s squadron was ready to
move precisely at the same moment that Wellington crossed the Agueda.
Its first descent was made on June 17th, a day exactly suitable for
alarming the Army of the North at the same time that Marmont’s first
appeals for help were likely to reach Caffarelli. The plan, as we shall
see, worked exceedingly well, and the fact that the Army of Portugal
got no reinforcements from Burgos or Biscay was due entirely to the
dismay caused to Caffarelli by this unexpected descent on his rear. He
conceived that the squadron carried a large landing force, and that he
was about to see Biscay slip out of his hands. The tale of this useful
diversion will be told in its due place.</p>

<p>There was yet one more item in the long list of outlying
distractions on which Wellington relied for the vexing of the French.
He was strongly of opinion that Suchet would spare troops to reinforce
King Joseph at Madrid, if his own invasion of Leon had a prosperous
start. Indeed, he somewhat overvalued the Duke of Albufera’s will and
power to interfere in central Spain, his idea being that King Joseph
had a much more direct control over the Valencian and Aragonese armies
than was really the case. One of the king’s intercepted dispatches,
directing Suchet to send troops into La Mancha, had fallen into
his hands, and he was unaware that the Marshal had refused to obey
it, and had found plausible reasons to cloak his disobedience<a
id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>.</p>

<p>The opportunity of finding means to harass Suchet depended on the
general posture of affairs in the Mediterranean caused by the outbreak
of the Russian war. As long as Napoleon kept a large army in Italy,
there was always a possibility that he might some day try a descent on
Sicily, where the authority of King Ferdinand rested on the bayonets
of a strong British garrison. There were a dozen red-coated battalions
always ready in Sicily, beside the rather inefficient forces of King
Ferdinand. In September 1810 Murat had massed a Franco-Neapolitan army
at Reggio, and tried an actual invasion, which ended ignominiously in
the capture of the only two battalions that succeeded in landing. But
by the early spring of 1812 it was known that nearly all the French
troops in Italy had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p.
342]</span> moved northward, and a great part of Murat’s Neapolitan
army with them. By April, indeed, there was only one French division
left in the whole Peninsula, nearly all the old ‘Army of Italy’ having
marched across the Alps. Lord William Bentinck, the commander of the
British forces in Sicily, had early notice of these movements, and
being a man of action and enterprising mind, though too much given to
wavering councils and rapid changes of purpose, was anxious to turn
the new situation to account. He was divided between two ideas—the
one which appealed to him most was to make a bold descent on the
under-garrisoned Italian peninsula, either to stir up trouble in
Calabria—where the ruthless government of Murat’s military satraps
had barely succeeded in keeping down rebellion, but had not crushed
its spirit—or, farther away, in the former dominions of the Pope and
the small dukes of the Austrian connexion. But the memory of the
fruitless attempt against the Italian mainland in 1809 under Sir John
Stuart survived as a warning: it was doubtful whether the occasional
adventurers who came to Palermo to promise insurrection in northern
Italy had any backing<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394"
class="fnanchor">[394]</a>, and though Calabria was a more promising
field, it was to be remembered that such troops as the enemy still
retained were mainly concentrated there. Thus it came to pass that
Lord William Bentinck at times despaired of all Italian expeditions,
and thought of sending a force to Catalonia or Valencia to harass
Suchet. ‘I cannot but imagine,’ he wrote, ‘that the occasional
disembarkation at different points of a large regular force must
considerably annoy the enemy, and create an important diversion for
other Spanish operations<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395"
class="fnanchor">[395]</a>.’ But when he wrote this, early in the
year, he was hankering after descents on Elba and Corsica—the latter
a most wild inspiration! These schemes the ministry very wisely
condemned: Lord Liverpool wrote in reply that ‘though there might be a
considerable degree of dissatisfaction, and even of ferment, pervading
the greater part of Italy,’ there was no evidence of any systematic
conspiracy to shake off the yoke of France. Corsica and Elba, even if
conquered, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span>
only be of secondary importance. A diversion to be made upon the east
coast of Spain would be far the best way in which the disposable
force in Sicily could be employed. Wellington had been informed of
the proposal, and might probably be able to lend part of the garrison
of Cadiz, to make the expedition more formidable. Sir Edward Pellew,
the admiral commanding on the Mediterranean station, would be able
to give advice, and arrange for the co-operation of the fleet<a
id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. Lord
Liverpool wrote on the next day (March 4) to inform Wellington of the
answer that had been made to Bentinck, but pointed out that probably
the aid could only be given from May to October, as the expedition
would depend on the fleet, and naval men thought that it would be
impossible to keep a large squadron in attendance on the Sicilian
force during the winter months. The troops would probably have to
return to their old quarters at the close of autumn<a id="FNanchor_397"
href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>Wellington, as it chanced, was already in communication with
Bentinck, for the latter had sent his brother, Lord Frederick, to
Lisbon, with a dispatch for the Commander-in-Chief in Portugal, in
which he stated that he leaned himself to the Corsican scheme, but that
if the home government disliked it, he would be prepared to send in
April or May an expedition of 10,000 men to operate against Suchet<a
id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>.
The letter from London reached Wellington first, about March 20th<a
id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>, and
was a source of great joy to him, as he saw that the Cabinet intended
to prohibit the Italian diversion, and wished to direct Bentinck’s
men towards Spain. He wrote to London and to Palermo, to state that a
descent upon the coast of Catalonia seemed to him ‘the most essential
object.’ It should be aimed at Barcelona or Tarragona: it might not
succeed so far as its immediate object was concerned, but it would
have the infallible result of forcing Suchet to come up with all his
available forces from Valencia, and would prevent him from interfering
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span> affairs
of western and central Spain during the next campaign. Ten thousand
men, even with such aid as Lacy and the Catalan army might give,
were probably insufficient to deal with a place of such strength as
Barcelona; but Tarragona, which was weakly garrisoned, might well be
taken. Even if it were not, a great point would be gained in opening
up communication with the Catalans, and throwing all the affairs of
the French in eastern Spain into confusion. Bentinck was advised in
the strongest terms to land north of the Ebro, and not in Valencia: an
attack on Catalonia would draw Suchet out of Valencia, which would then
fall of its own accord. Wellington added, writing to Lord Liverpool
only, not to Bentinck, that he did not see how any appreciable aid
could be got from the Cadiz garrison, or those of Tarifa or Cartagena<a
id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>:
the British regiments there had been cut down to a necessary minimum,
but there were 1,400 Portuguese and two foreign regiments, of whom
some might possibly be spared. The government must give him a definite
order to detach such and such battalions, and it should be done—the
responsibility being their own. Lord Frederick Bentinck arrived from
Palermo at Badajoz just after that place fell: Wellington charged him
with additional advices for his brother, to the effect that he would
send him a siege-train and officers and gunners to work it, which might
serve to batter Tarragona, if that proved possible. Though he could
himself spare no British troops, the Spanish Regency should be urged to
lend, for an expedition to Catalonia, two divisions, one under Roche
at Alicante, the other under Whittingham in Majorca, which consisted
each of 3,000 men recently entrusted for training to those British
officers. Their aid was hardly likely to be refused, and they had been
better trained, fed, and clothed of late than other Spanish troops.
Wellington was not deceived in this expectation, the Regency very
handsomely offered to place both divisions at Bentinck’s disposition<a
id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>, and
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span> turned out
to have swelled in numbers of late, owing to vigorous recruiting of
dispersed men from Blake’s defunct army. The available figure was far
over the 6,000 of which Wellington had spoken.</p>

<p>There seemed, therefore, in May to be every probability that
a force of some 17,000 men might be available for the descent on
Catalonia which Wellington advised: and both Admiral Pellew and
Roche and Whittingham made active preparations to be found in
perfect readiness when Lord William Bentinck should start off the
nucleus of the expeditionary force from Palermo<a id="FNanchor_402"
href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. Wellington had
fixed the third week in June as the date at which the appearance
of the diversion would be most effective<a id="FNanchor_403"
href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. On June 5th he was
able to state that two separate divisions of transports had already
been sent off from Lisbon, one to Alicante and one to Majorca, to pick
up the two Spanish divisions.</p>

<p>Now, however, came a deplorable check to the plan, which only became
known to Wellington when he had already committed himself to his
campaign against Marmont. Bentinck could never get out of his head the
original idea of Italian conquest which he had laid before the Cabinet
in January. There was no doubt that it had been discouraged by the
home government, and that he had received very distinct instructions
that Spain was to be the sphere of his activity, and that he was to
take Wellington into his councils. But Lord Liverpool’s dispatch
had contained the unfortunate phrase that ‘unless the project of
resistance to the French power in Italy should appear to rest upon much
better grounds than those of which we are at present apprised,’ the
diversion to Catalonia was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p.
346]</span> obvious course<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404"
class="fnanchor">[404]</a>.’ This gave a discretionary power to
Bentinck, if he should judge that evidence of discontent in Italy
had cropped up in unexpected quantity and quality since March. It
does not appear, to the unprejudiced observer, that such evidence
was forthcoming in May. But Bentinck, with his original prejudice
in favour of a descent on Italy running in his brain, chose to take
certain secret correspondence received from the Austrian general
Nugent, and other sources, as justification for holding back from
the immediate action in eastern Spain, on which Wellington had been
led to rely. No troops sailed from Palermo or Messina till the very
end of June, and then the numbers sent were much less than had been
promised, and the directions given to Maitland, the general entrusted
with the command, were by no means satisfactory<a id="FNanchor_405"
href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. The underlying fact
would appear to be that, since March, Bentinck had begun to be alarmed
at the intrigues of the Queen of Sicily, and feared to send away
British troops so far afield as Spain. That notorious princess and her
incapable spouse had been deprived in the preceding autumn of their
ancient status as absolute sovereigns, and a Sicilian constitution and
parliament, somewhat on the British model, had been called into being.
For some time it had been supposed that Caroline, though incensed,
was powerless to do harm, and the native Sicilians were undoubtedly
gratified by the change. But Bentinck presently detected traces of a
conspiracy fostered by the Queen among the Italian and mercenary troops
employed by the Sicilian government: and, what was more surprising,
it was suspected (and proved later on) that the court had actually
opened up negotiations with Napoleon and even with Murat, in order to
get rid of the English from Sicily at all costs<a id="FNanchor_406"
href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>. In view of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span> fact that there were
8,000 Italian and foreign troops of doubtful disposition quartered in
Sicily, Bentinck was seized with qualms at the idea of sending away
a large expedition, mainly composed of British regiments. In the end
he compromised, by detaching only three British and two German Legion
battalions, along with a miscellaneous collection of fractions of
several foreign corps, making 7,000 men in all<a id="FNanchor_407"
href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>. They only arrived
off the coast of Catalonia on July 31st, and Maitland’s freedom of
operations was hampered by instructions to the effect that ‘the
division of the Sicilian army detached has for its first object the
safety of Sicily; its employment on the Spanish coast is temporary.’
He was told that he was liable to be withdrawn at any moment, if
complications arose in Sicily or Italy, and was not to consider himself
a permanent part of the British army in Spain. Yet at the same time
that Bentinck had given these orders, the home government had told
Wellington to regard the expeditionary force as placed at his disposal,
and authorized him to send directions to it.</p>

<p>All this worked out less unhappily than might have been expected;
for though Wellington got little practical military help from
the Sicilian corps, and though Maitland’s operations were most
disappointing and started far too late, yet the knowledge that great
transport squadrons were at Alicante and Majorca, and the rumour that
a large force was coming from Sicily, most certainly kept Suchet in a
state of alarm, and prevented him from helping Soult or King Joseph.
It is interesting to find from his correspondence<a id="FNanchor_408"
href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> that in the earliest
days of July he was anxiously watching the ships at Alicante, and
expecting a descent either on Valencia or on Catalonia, though Maitland
was yet far away, and did not appear off<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span> Palamos till July 31. The fear of the
descent was an admirable help to Wellington—perhaps more useful than
its actual appearance at an early date might have been, since the
expeditionary troops were decidedly less in numbers than Wellington
had hoped or Suchet had feared. At the same time the news that the
Sicilian force had not sailed, and perhaps might never appear, reached
Salamanca at one of the most critical moments of the campaign, and
filled Wellington with fears that the Army of Valencia might already be
detaching troops against him, while he had calculated upon its being
entirely distracted by the projected demonstration<a id="FNanchor_409"
href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>. The news that Maitland
had sailed at last, only came to hand some time after the battle of
Salamanca had been won, when the whole position in Spain had assumed a
new and more satisfactory aspect.</p>

<p>Such were the subsidiary schemes with which Wellington supported his
main design of a direct advance against Marmont’s army. Some of them
worked well—Hill, Home Popham, and Mendizabal did all, and more than
all, that had been expected of them, in the way of containing large
French forces. Others accomplished all that could in reason have been
hoped—such was the case with Silveira and Ballasteros. Others fell far
below the amount of usefulness that had been reckoned upon—both the
Galician army and the Sicilian army proved most disappointing in the
timing of their movements and the sum of their achievements. But on the
whole the plan worked—the French generals in all parts of Spain were
distracted, and Marmont got little help from without.</p>

<p>It is certain that, at the moment of Wellington’s starting on
his offensive campaign, the thing that gave him most trouble and
anxiety was not the timing or efficacy of the various diver<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span>sions that he had planned,
but a purely financial problem. It was now a matter of years since the
money due for the pay and maintenance of the army had been coming in
with terrible unpunctuality. Officers and men had grown to regard it
as normal that their pay should be four or six months in arrears: the
muleteers and camp followers were in even worse case. And the orders
for payment (<i>vales</i> as they were called) issued by the commissariat
to the peasantry, were so tardily settled in cash, that the recipients
would often sell them for half or two-thirds of their face value to
speculators in Lisbon, who could afford to wait many months for the
money.</p>

<p>This state of things was deplorable: but it did not proceed, as
Napier usually hints, and as Wellington himself seems sometimes to
have felt, from perversity on the part of the home government. It was
not the case that there was gold or silver in London, and that the
ministers did not send it with sufficient promptness. No one can be so
simple as to suppose that Lord Liverpool, Mr. Perceval, the Marquess
of Wellesley, or Lord Castlereagh, did not understand that the Army of
Portugal must have cash, or it would lose that mobility which was its
great strength. Still less would they wittingly starve it, when the
fortunes of the ministry were bound up with the successful conduct of
the war.</p>

<p>But the years 1811-12, as has been already pointed out in the
last volume of this work, were those of the greatest stringency
in the cash-market of Great Britain. The country was absolutely
drained dry of metallic currency in the precious metals: no silver
had been coined at the Mint since the Revolutionary war began: no
guineas since 1798. England was transacting all her internal business
on bank-notes, and gold was a rare commodity, only to be got by
high prices and much searching. This was the time when the Jews
of Portsmouth used to board every home-coming transport, to offer
convalescents or sailors 27<i>s.</i>, or even more, in paper for every
guinea that they had on them. The Spanish dollar, though weighing
much less than an English five-shilling piece (when that valuable
antiquity could be found<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410"
class="fnanchor">[410]</a>), readily passed for six shillings in paper.
And even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span> this coin
could not now be got so easily as in 1809 or 1810, for the growing
state of disturbance in the Spanish-American colonies was beginning to
affect the annual import of silver from the mines of Mexico and Peru,
which had for a long time been the main source from which bullion for
Europe was procured. To buy dollars at Cadiz with bills on London
was becoming a much more difficult business. In May 1812 a special
complication was introduced—Lord William Bentinck wishing to provide
Spanish coin for the expedition which was about to sail for Catalonia,
sent agents to Gibraltar, who bought with Sicilian gold all the dollars
that they could procure, giving a reckless price for them, equivalent
to over six shillings a dollar, and competing with Wellington’s regular
correspondents who were at the same moment offering only 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
or 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the coin. Of course the higher offer secured the
cash, and Wellington made bitter complaints that the market had been
spoilt, and that he suddenly found himself shut out from a supply
on which he had hitherto reckoned with security<a id="FNanchor_411"
href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. But the competition
was only transient, though very tiresome at a moment when silver coin
was specially wanted for payments in Leon. For, as Wellington remarked,
the people about Salamanca had never seen the British army before,
and would be wanting to do business on a prompt cash basis, not being
accustomed to credit, as were the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The army started upon the campaign with a military chest in the
most deplorable state of depletion. ‘We are absolutely bankrupt,’
wrote Wellington, ‘the troops are now five months in arrears instead
of one month in advance. The staff have not been paid since February;
the muleteers not since June 1811! and we are in debt in all parts
of the country. I am obliged to take money sent me by my brother
[Henry Wellesley, British Minister at Cadiz] for the Spaniards,
in order to give my own troops a fortnight’s pay, who are really
suffering for want of money<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412"
class="fnanchor">[412]</a>.’ Some weeks before this last complaint
Wellington had sounded an even louder note of alarm. ‘We owe not less
than 5,000,000 dollars. The Portuguese troops and establishments
are likewise in the greatest distress, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> it is my opinion, as well as that of
Marshal Beresford, that we must disband part of that army, unless I can
increase the monthly payments of the subsidy. The Commissary-General
has this day informed me that he is very apprehensive that he will
not be able to make good his engagements for the payment for the
meat for the troops. If we are obliged to stop that payment, your
Lordship may as well prepare to recall the army, for it will be
impossible to carry up salt meat (as well as bread) to the troops from
the sea-coast.... It is not improbable that we may not be able to
take advantage of the enemy’s comparative weakness in this campaign
<i>for sheer want of money</i><a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413"
class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.’ One almost feels that Wellington is here
painting the position of the army in the blackest possible colours,
in order to bring pressure on his correspondent at home. But this
dismal picture was certainly reflected in the language of his staff
at the time: a letter from his aide-de-camp, Colin Campbell, speaks
(on May 30) of the depleted state of the military chest being a
possible curb to the campaign: ‘Lord W. cannot take supplies with him
to enable him to do more than demonstrate towards Valladolid, when
so good an opportunity offers, and an inconsiderable addition would
suffice. The harvest is ripening, the country round Salamanca is full
of all requisite supplies, but they are not procurable without cash<a
id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>.’</p>

<p>Yet it is hard to be over-censorious of the home government. They
were in the most bitter straits for money. Gold and silver were simply
not to be got in the quantities that Wellington required. The amount
actually sent was very large: it would have been larger if economic
conditions had not been desperate. The rupture with the United States
of America which took place in June (fortunately too late to serve
Napoleon’s purpose), had just added a new source of anxiety to the
troubles of the Cabinet: both money and men were now wanted for Canada.
There can be no doubt that when Lord Bathurst wrote, in the middle of
the Salamanca campaign, that ‘£100,000 in cash, chiefly gold, had been
sent off,’ and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span>
‘I wish to God we could assist you more in money,’ he was writing quite
honestly, and amid most adverse financial circumstances. Great Britain
was at the most exhausting point of her long struggle with Napoleon.
The Russian war had begun—but there was no sign as yet that it was
to be the ruin of the Emperor: his armies seemed to be penetrating
towards Moscow in the old triumphant style: many politicians spoke of
a humiliating peace dictated to Czar Alexander in the autumn as the
probable end of the campaign, and speculated on Napoleon’s appearance
at Madrid in 1813 as a possible event. Wheat had risen in this spring
to 130<i>s.</i> the quarter. The outbreak of the long-threatened but
long-averted American war looked like the last blow that was to break
down the British Empire. It was no wonder that the national credit was
low in June 1812. There was nothing to revive it till Wellington’s
Salamanca triumph in July: nor did any one understand that Napoleon’s
star had passed its zenith, till the news of the disasters of the
Moscow retreat began to drift westward in November and December.</p>

    CENTRAL SPAIN
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">Meanwhile, if the financial outlook was gloomy, the
actual military situation was more promising than it had ever been
before. Well aware, from intercepted dispatches, of the quarrels of
his adversaries, and perfectly informed as to their numbers and their
cantonments, Wellington considered with justice that he had such a game
in his hands as he had never before had set before him. On June 13th he
crossed the Agueda with his army in three parallel columns. The left
was under charge of Picton, and consisted of the 3rd Division, Pack’s
and Bradford’s Portuguese, and Le Marchant’s brigade of heavy dragoons.
The centre, which Beresford conducted, was composed of the Light, 4th,
and 5th Divisions. It was preceded by Alten’s German hussars, and
accompanied by Bock’s dragoons. The right column, under Graham, had
the 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, with a regiment of Anson’s horse for
purposes of exploration. It is to be noted that both Picton and Graham
were destined to remain only a few weeks with the army: the former
had taken the field ere his Badajoz wound was properly healed: it
broke open again, he fell into a high fever, and had to be sent to the
rear. Wellington’s brother-in-law, Pakenham,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_353">[p. 353]</span> took over charge of the 3rd Division on
June 28th. Graham had been suffering for some months from an affection
of the eyes, which the physicians told him might at any time grow
worse and threaten his sight. He persisted on staying with the army
till the last possible moment, but became more blind each day, and
was compelled to throw up his command on July 6th and to return to
England for skilled medical advice. Thus, during the greater part of
the Salamanca campaign, Wellington was working without his best-trusted
lieutenants—Craufurd was dead, both Picton and Graham invalided. In
consequence of Graham’s departure a very difficult point was raised.
If some illness or wound should disable the Commander-in-Chief,
to whom would the charge of operations fall<a id="FNanchor_415"
href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>? Wellington considered
that Beresford was entitled to expect the succession, and deprecated
the sending out of some senior officer from England with a commission
to act as second in command. He observed that no one coming fresh
from home would have a real grasp of the conditions of the war: that
he would probably start with <i>a priori</i> views, and have to unlearn
them in a time of imminent danger. Moreover, a second-in-command was,
when his superior was in good health, either an unnecessary person
or else a tiresome one, if he presumed on his position to offer
advice or remonstrances. Fortunately the question remained a wholly
academic one, since Wellington’s iron physique, and unbroken luck when
bullets were flying, never failed him. An understudy turned out to be
superfluous.</p>

<p>The three columns of the allied army advanced on a very narrow
front of not more than ten miles, though the cavalry spread out
considerably to the flanks. On the 13th the columns bivouacked on
the Guadapero river, in front of Ciudad Rodrigo, between Santi
Espiritus and Tenebron. On the 14th they advanced four leagues to
the Huebra, and camped on each side of San Muñoz, with head-quarters
at Cabrillas. On the 15th a rather longer march took them to Matilla
and Cayos. Nothing had yet been seen of any enemy. It was only on
the 16th, in the morning, that the advanced cavalry of the centre
column, after crossing the Valmusa river, came into contact with two
squadrons of French <i>chasseurs</i>, not more than two leagues<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span> outside of Salamanca.
These outposts gave way when pushed, and retired across the Tormes.
The British army bivouacked in sight of Salamanca that night, and
received the information that Marmont had already evacuated the city,
save for a garrison left in its three new forts<a id="FNanchor_416"
href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.</p>

<p>The Army of Portugal had been caught, just as Wellington had hoped,
in a condition of wide dispersion. It was not that Marmont did not
expect the attack, but that, till the day when it should be actually
delivered, he dared not concentrate, because of his want of magazines
and the paucity of transport. He had resolved that he must be content
to abandon all the land west of Salamanca, in order that his point of
concentration should be out of reach of his enemy’s first stroke. It
was fixed at Bleines and Fuente Sauco, twenty miles north of Salamanca
on the road to Toro. On the morning of the 14th, when the news that
Wellington was over the Agueda first reached him, the Marshal issued
orders to all his divisions to march on this point, not even excepting
that of Bonnet in the Asturias. For, despite of the Emperor’s wish to
keep a hold upon that province, Marmont held, and rightly, that it
was more important to place in front of the Anglo-Portuguese every
possible bayonet, and he could not spare a solid division of 6,500
men. Unfortunately for him, however, it was clear that Bonnet could
not arrive for fifteen or twenty days. The other seven divisions
were concentrated by the fifth night from the giving of the alarm<a
id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.
They formed a mass of 36,000 infantry, with 80 guns, but only 2,800
horse. This total does not include either Bonnet, nor three battalions
of Thomières’s division left to hold Astorga, nor small garrisons
placed in Toro, Zamora, the Salamanca forts,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> and certain other posts farther east<a
id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>. Nor
does it take account of a dépôt of 3,000 men, including many dismounted
dragoons, at Valladolid. The total of the field army, including
artillery, sappers, &amp;c., was about 40,000 of all arms.</p>

<p>This force was distinctly inferior in number to that of the
Anglo-Portuguese, who, without counting three infantry battalions on
their way to the front from Lisbon, or D’Urban’s Portuguese horse
on the side of Zamora, had some 40,000 infantry in line, and 3,500
excellent cavalry, in which arm Wellington, for the first time in
his life, had a slight advantage over the enemy. Carlos de España
was also approaching, with the 3,000 Spanish infantry that were
available after the garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo had been completed,
and in all the allied army must have had 48,000 men at the front<a
id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>. The
balance of numbers, of which each general was pretty well informed,
was such as to make both sides careful—Marmont was 8,000 men short of
his adversary’s power, and was particularly depressed by the knowledge
of his inferiority in cavalry, an arm on which the French had hitherto
relied with confidence. But the horse of the Army of Portugal had
never recovered from the consequences of Masséna’s retreat in the last
spring, and all the regiments were very weak: while Wellington was
at last profiting from the liberal way in which the home government
had reinforced his mounted arm during the autumn of 1811. He had ten
British regiments with him, whereas at Fuentes de Oñoro he had owned
but four.</p>

<p>On the other hand Wellington, among his 48,000 men, had only 28,000
British; there were 17,000 Portuguese and 3,000 Spaniards with him, and
excellent though the conduct of the former had been during the late
campaign, it would be hypocrisy to pretend that their commander could
rely upon them under all circumstances, as he would have done upon a
corresponding number of British infantry. He was ready to give battle,
but it must be a battle under favourable conditions. Marmont felt much
the same: it was necessary to beat Wellington if the French domination
in Spain was to be preserved. But it would<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> be rash to attack him in one of his
favourite defensive positions: there must be no more Bussacos. And
every available man must be gathered in, before a general action was
risked. The only justification for instant battle would be the unlikely
chance of catching the Anglo-Portuguese army in a state of dispersion
or some other unlucky posture—and Wellington’s known caution did not
make such a chance very probable.</p>

<p>Marmont’s main purpose, indeed, was to hold Wellington ‘contained’
till he should have succeeded in bringing up Bonnet, and also
reinforcements from the Armies of the North and Centre—if not even from
some distant forces. On Bonnet’s eventual arrival he could rely—but
not on any fixed date for his appearance, for it was difficult to get
orders promptly to the Asturias, and there might be many unforeseen
delays in their execution. But Marmont was also counting on aid from
Caffarelli, which would presumably reach him even before Bonnet
appeared. In expectation of Wellington’s advance, he had written to the
Commander of the Army of the North on May 24th and 30th, and again on
June 5th, asking for assurances of help, and reminding his colleague
of the Emperor’s directions. The answers received were, on the whole,
satisfactory: the last of them, dated at Vittoria on June 14th, said
that the disposable field-force was 8,000 men, including a brigade of
light cavalry and 22 guns. They should march from Vittoria as soon
as some troops of Abbé’s division arrived from Pampeluna to replace
them, and they should be écheloned along the high-road from Burgos
to Valladolid ready to move up when called upon<a id="FNanchor_420"
href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>. It must be remembered
that on this date Caffarelli was answering a hypothetical inquiry
as to his exact power to help, not a definite demand for men, since
Wellington had only crossed the Agueda on the previous day, and nothing
was known at Vittoria of his actual start. But the dispatch was
encouraging, as it seemed to show a good spirit, and named the exact
force available, and the route that it would take. Marmont received
it upon the 19th, just as he had completed his own concentration at
Fuente Sauco. It seemed to justify him in believing that before July
1 he would have 8,000 men from Caffarelli at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span> his disposition, including, what was
specially valuable, 1,000 horse.</p>

<p>The dispatches from King Joseph and Jourdan were less satisfactory.
At this moment they were in a state of hesitation caused by
contradictory intelligence. ‘Your letter of June 6th,’ wrote Jourdan
to Marmont, ‘says that Wellington will soon fall upon you. But we have
similar letters from Soult, declaring that the blow is to be delivered
against him: he encloses two notes of June 2nd and 5th from General
Daricau in Estremadura, declaring that 60,000 of the allies are just
about to begin an invasion of Andalusia. We are too far off from the
scene of operations to determine whether it is you or the Duke of
Dalmatia who is deceived. We can only tell you, meanwhile, not to be
misled by demonstrations, and to be ready to start off three divisions
to Soult’s help without a moment’s delay, if Lord Wellington’s real
objective is Andalusia. Similarly we have sent Soult express orders
that he shall move Drouet to the north bank of the Tagus, if Wellington
has called up Hill to join him, and is making the true attack on you.
Caffarelli has stringent orders to support you with what troops he can
collect, when you are able to tell him definitely that you are the
person threatened, not Soult<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421"
class="fnanchor">[421]</a>.’</p>

<p>It is clear that the hallucinations of the Duke of Dalmatia were
most valuable to Wellington, who had foreseen them long ago by a
study of intercepted dispatches. Whatever happened, Soult could not
refrain from believing that he had the great rôle to play, and that his
Andalusian viceroyalty was the centre of all things. At this moment
his picture of Wellington about to move on Cordova with 60,000 men
seems to have been a belated conception caused by Graham’s march to
Elvas on May 20. He had not yet realized that ten days later Graham’s
corps had gone northward again, and had joined Wellington on the
Agueda about the time that he was writing his alarmist letters. There
was nothing in front of him save Hill’s 18,000 men: but he refused
to see the facts, and deceived Joseph and Jourdan for some days by
the definite and authoritative restatement of absolutely erroneous
intelligence. Hence it was not till Marmont was able to say, without
any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span> possible chance
of error, that Wellington was across the Agueda, and had advanced to
Salamanca at the head of at least 40,000 men, that the King and his
Chief-of-the-Staff at last recognized the true seat of danger. Long
after they had detected it, they continued (as we shall see) to receive
preposterous dispatches from Soult, still maintaining that they were
mistaken, and still discovering excuses for not obeying the peremptory
orders that they sent him.</p>

  <p class="subh3">THE SALAMANCA FORTS. TEN DAYS OF MANŒUVRES,<br />
    <span class="smcap">JUNE 20th-30th</span>, 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington’s</span> conduct on reaching
Salamanca was not that which might have been expected. When a general
has, by a careful and well-arranged concentration, collected all his
own troops into one solid mass, and then by a rapid advance has thrown
himself into the midst of the scattered cantonments of an enemy who has
no superiority to him in numbers, it is natural for him to press his
pursuit vigorously. Far the most effective way of opening the campaign
would have been to cut up the two divisions which Marmont had just led
out of Salamanca, or at least to follow them so closely that they could
be brought to action before all the outlying divisions had come in.
This would certainly have been Napoleon’s method.</p>

<p>Wellington, however, wanted to fight a battle in one of his
favourite defensive positions, and he thought that he had a means of
compelling Marmont to attack him, by laying siege to the Salamanca
forts. After Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, no French marshal would like
to see a third important post captured ‘under his nose.’ The British
general judged that Marmont would fight him, in order to save his
prestige and his garrison. And since he believed that Bonnet would not
evacuate the Asturias, and that Caffarelli would send help late, if at
all, he thought that he could count upon a superiority of numbers which
rendered victory certain.</p>

<p>This seems to be the only rational way of explaining Wellington’s
conduct on June 17th. On arriving in front of Salamanca his army made
a majestic encircling movement, Picton’s column crossing the Tormes
by the fords of El Canto below the city, Beresford’s and Graham’s by
those of Santa Marta above it. The use of the unbroken town-bridge was
made impossible by Marmont’s forts. The heads of the two columns met on
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> north side, and
they then moved three miles on, and took up a long position below the
heights of San Cristobal, which lie outside Salamanca on its northern
and eastern front. These formed the chosen defensive fighting-ground
which Wellington had already in his mind.</p>

<p>Only the 14th Light Dragoons and Clinton’s infantry of the 6th
Division turned into Salamanca by the Toro gate, and acted as
Wellington’s escort, while he was received by the municipality and
made his arrangements for the attack on the forts, which, though they
commanded the bridge, had no outlook on the spacious arcaded Plaza
Mayor, where the reception took place. It was a lively scene. ‘We
were received with shouts and <i>vivas</i>,’ writes an eye-witness. ‘The
inhabitants were out of their senses at having got rid of the French,
and nearly pulled Lord Wellington off his horse. The ladies were the
most violent, many coming up to him and embracing him. He kept writing
orders upon his sabretash, and was interrupted three or four times by
them. What with the joy of the people, and the feeling accompanying
troops about to attack a fortress, it was a half-hour of suspense and
anxiety, and a scene of such interest as I never before witnessed<a
id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>.’</p>

<p>Head-quarters were established that night in the city, and Clinton’s
division invested the forts, which looked formidable enough to require
close study before they were attacked. The rest of the army took up
its bivouacs, with the cavalry out in front, and remained practically
without movement on the ground now selected, for the next two days,
till Marmont came to pay his expected visit.</p>

<p>The three Salamanca forts were built on high ground in the
south-west corner of the city, which overlooks the long Roman bridge.
To make them Marmont had destroyed a great part of the old University
quarter of the place, levelling the majority of the colleges—for
Salamanca, till 1808, had been a university of the English rather than
the usual continental type, and had owned a score of such institutions.
Nearly all the buildings on the slopes had been pulled down, leaving
a wide open glacis round three massive convents, which had been
transformed into places of strength. San Vincente occupied the crest
of the knoll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span>
overlooking the river, and lay in the extreme angle of the old city
wall, which enclosed it on two sides. The smaller strongholds, San
Cayetano and La Merced, were separated from San Vincente by a narrow
but steep ravine, and lay close together on another rising-ground of
about the same height. The three formed a triangle with crossing fires,
each to a large extent commanding the ground over which the others
would have to be approached. The south and west sides of San Vincente
and La Merced overhung precipitous slopes above the river, and were
almost inaccessible. The north sides of San Cayetano and San Vincente
were the only fronts that looked promising for attack, and in each
elaborate preparations had been made in view of that fact. Marmont
had originally intended to enclose all three forts and many buildings
more—such as the Town Hospital, the convent of San Francisco, and the
colleges of Ireland and Cuenca, in an outer <i>enceinte</i>, to serve as
a large citadel which would contain several thousand men and all his
magazines. But money and time had failed, and on the slopes below the
forts, several convents and colleges, half pulled to pieces, were still
standing, and offered cover for besiegers at a distance of some 250
yards from the works. The garrison consisted of six flank-companies
from the 15th, 65th, 82nd, and 86th of the line and the 17th Léger,
and of a company of artillery, under the <i>chef de bataillon</i> Duchemin
of the 65th. They made up a total of 800 men, and had thirty-six guns
in position, of which, however, the greater part were only light
field-pieces: two guns (commanding the bridge) were in La Merced,
four in San Cayetano, the remaining thirty in San Vincente, the most
formidable of the three.</p>

<p>Wellington had come prepared to besiege ‘three fortified
convents,’ and had been sent a confused sketch of them drawn
by an amateur’s hand<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423"
class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. They turned out much stronger than he had
been led to expect, owing to the immense amount of hewn stone from the
demolished colleges and other buildings that was available to build
them up. The walls had been doubled in thickness, the windows stopped,
and scarps and counterscarps with solid masonry had been thrown
around them. The roofs of the two minor forts had been taken off, and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> upper stories
casemated, by massive oak beams with a thick coating of earth laid
upon them. This surface was so strong that guns, protected by sandbag
embrasures, had been mounted on it at some points. There was also an
ample provision of palisades, made from strong oak and chestnut beams.
Altogether it was clear that the works would require a systematic
battering, and were not mere patched-up mediaeval monasteries, as had
been expected.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, most vexatious to find that the very small
battering-train which Wellington had brought with him from Ciudad
Rodrigo was obviously insufficient for the task before it; there were
no more than four iron 18-pounder guns, with only 100 rounds of shot
each, at the front; though six 24-pound howitzers, from the train that
had taken Badajoz, were on their way from Elvas to join, and were due
on the 20th. It was not, however, howitzers so much as more heavy 18-or
24-pounders that were required for battering, and the lack of them
at the moment was made all the more irksome by the known fact that
there were plenty of both sorts at Rodrigo and Almeida, five or six
marches away. The mistake was precisely the same that was to be made
again at Burgos in the autumn—undervaluation of the means required
to deal with works of third-class importance. Whether Wellington
himself or his artillery and engineer advisers were primarily
responsible is not clear<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424"
class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.</p>

<p>The responsibility for the working out of the little siege with
inadequate means fell on Lieut.-Colonel Burgoyne, as senior engineer
(he had with him only two other officers of that corps and nine
military artificers!), and Lieut.-Colonel May, R.A., who was in charge
of the four 18-pounders. The latter borrowed three howitzers from
field-batteries to supplement his miserable means, and afterwards two
6-pounder field-guns, which, of course, were only for annoying the
garrison, not for battering.</p>

<p>It looked at first as if the only practicable scheme was to build
a battery for the 18-pounders on the nearest available ground, 250
yards from San Vincente to the north, and lower down the knoll on which
that fort stood. There was good cover from ruined buildings up to
this distance from the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p.
363]</span> works. On the night of the occupation of Salamanca 400
workmen of the 6th Division commenced a battery on the selected spot
and approaches leading to it from the cover in the ruins. The work done
was not satisfactory: it was nearly full moon, the night was short, and
the enemy (who knew well enough where the attack must begin), kept up a
lively fire of artillery and musketry all night. Unfortunately the 6th
Division workmen had no experience of sieges—they had never used pick
or shovel before, and there were only two engineer officers and nine
artificers to instruct them. ‘Great difficulty was found in keeping the
men to work under the fire: the Portuguese in particular absolutely
went on hands and knees, dragging their baskets along the ground<a
id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>.’ By
daylight the projected line of the battery was only knee-high, and gave
no cover, so that the men had to be withdrawn till dusk. An attempt
had been made during the night to ascertain whether it were possible
to creep forward to the ditch, and lay mines there, to blow in the
counterscarp. But the party who tried to reach the ditch were detected
by the barking of a dog, who alarmed the French out-picket, and the
explorers had to retire with several men wounded.</p>

<p>Seeing that the fire of the garrison was so effective, the officers
in charge of the siege asked for, and obtained from Wellington, three
hundred marksmen to keep down the <i>tiraillade</i>. They were taken from
the Light Brigade of the King’s German Legion, and spread among the
ruins to fire at the embrasures and loopholes of the French. They also
hoisted, with some difficulty, two field-guns on to the first floor of
the convent of San Bernardo, which lies north-west of San Vincente,
and kept up a lively discharge ‘out of the drawing-room window, so to
speak. We fired for some hours at each other, during which time an
unlucky shot went as completely through my captain’s (Eligé’s) heart
as possible. But considering how near we were, I am much surprised
that our loss was so slight—one killed and one wounded at my own gun<a
id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.’ But
the fire of the San Vincente artillery was by no means silenced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span></p> <p>On the
night of June 18th-19th the working party of the 6th Division succeeded
in finishing the battery which was to breach the main fort, and also
commenced two smaller batteries, to right and left, in places among the
ruins, one by the College of Cuenca, the other below San Bernardo<a
id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>.
On the morning of the 19th the four 18-pounders and three howitzers
opened, and brought down the upper courses of the masonry of that part
of San Vincente on which they were trained. But they could not move its
lower part, or reach the counterscarp. Wherefore two howitzers were
put into the second battery, near the College of Cuenca, which could
command the counterscarp. The play of these guns proved insufficient,
however, to shake it, and the garrison concentrated such a fire upon
them, mainly from musketry at loopholes, that twenty gunners were
killed or hurt while working the two howitzers.</p>

<p>Next morning Dickson’s six howitzers from Elvas came up, and served
to replace those borrowed from the field companies, wherefore there was
only an addition of three pieces net to the battering-train. Two of the
18-pounders were moved round to the battery (No. 2) which had been so
hard hit on the preceding day: their fire proved much more effective
than that of the howitzers, and brought down an angle of the upper wall
of San Vincente and part of its roof, which fell on and crushed many of
the French.</p>

<p>But on the 21st it was impossible to continue the battering, for
the ignominious reason that there were hardly any more shot left
to fire. Only sixty balls remained in store for the 18-pounders,
and a little over one hundred for the howitzers<a id="FNanchor_428"
href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. The calculations
of the besiegers had been so erroneous that they had used up their
stock just as the critical moment had arrived. On the previous day
Wellington, seeing what was coming, had sent a hurried message to
Almeida for more shot and powder—but the convoy, though urged on with
all possible speed, did not arrive at Salamanca till the 26th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the general engagement for which Wellington<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span> had prepared himself
seemed likely to come off. Marmont had all his army, save Bonnet
alone, collected by the 19th, at Fuente Sauco. On the following day
he came boldly forward and drove in the British cavalry vedettes.
He showed three columns moving on a parallel front, which observers
estimated at 18,000 foot and 2,000 horse—but there were more behind,
still invisible. At four in the afternoon he was drawing so close that
Wellington assumed his battle position. Five divisions and the two
independent Portuguese brigades formed the fighting-line, from San
Cristobal southward to Cabrerizos on the bank of the Tormes: the order
was (from right to left) 1st-7th-4th-Light-3rd-Pack and Bradford. The
reserve was composed of the 5th Division, of Hulse’s brigade of the
6th (of which the remainder was left to blockade the Salamanca forts),
and of Carlos de España’s 3,000 Spaniards. Alten’s cavalry covered the
British right, Ponsonby’s<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> the left, Bock’s and Le Marchant’s heavy
squadrons were in reserve.</p>

<p>It looked at first as though Marmont intended to force on the battle
that Wellington desired. Moving with great order and decision, his
three columns deployed opposite the heights, and advanced to within a
very moderate distance of them—not more than 800 yards at one point.
They were extremely visible, as the whole country-side below the
British position was a fine plain covered with ripening wheat. The
only breaks in the surface were the infrequent villages—in this part
of Spain they are all large and far apart—and a few dry watercourses,
whose line could be detected winding amid the interminable cornfields.
Warning to keep off the position was given to the French by long-range
fire from several of the British batteries on salient points of the
line. The enemy replied noisily and with many guns: Wellington’s
officers judged that he was doing his best to make his approach audible
to the garrison of the besieged forts.</p>

<p>At dusk the French occupied the village of Castellanos de Morisco,
in front of the right centre of the heights, and then advanced a
regiment to attack Morisco, which was absolutely at the foot of them,
and had been occupied by Wellington as an advanced post. It was held
by the 68th regiment from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[p.
366]</span> 7th Division, a battalion which had come out from England
in the preceding autumn, but had, by chance, never been engaged before.
It made a fine defence, and beat off three attacks upon the village:
but after dark Wellington called it back uphill to the line of the
position, abandoning Morisco<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430"
class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. Apparently he was glad to see the French
pressing in close, and looked for an attack upon his position next
morning. Standing on the sky-line above Castellanos at dusk, with a map
in his hand, he demonstrated to all the assembled generals commanding
divisions the exact part which they were to play, till several French
round-shot compelled him to shift his position a little farther back<a
id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>. The
whole army slept that night in order of battle, with strong pickets
pushed down to the foot of the slopes.</p>

<p>There was, however, no attack at dawn. Marmont’s two rear divisions
(those of Foy and Thomières) and a brigade of dragoons were not yet on
the ground, and only got up in the course of the afternoon: hence he
was naturally unwilling to move, as he had a certain knowledge that
he was outnumbered. It would seem that Wellington had, that morning,
an opportunity of crushing his enemy, which he must have regretted to
have lost on many subsequent days of the campaign. Marmont’s position
was one of very great risk: he had pushed in so close to the British
heights, that he might have been attacked and brought to action in half
an hour, and could not have got away without fighting. His position was
visible from end to end—it had no flank protection, and its only strong
points were the two villages of Morisco and Castellanos de Morisco on
its left centre. Behind was an undulating sea of cornfields extending
to the horizon. Wellington (after deducting the two missing brigades
of the 6th Division) could have come down in a general charge from his
heights, with 37,000 Anglo-Portuguese infantry, and 3,500 horse—not
to speak of Carlos de España’s 3,000 Spaniards. Marmont had only
five divisions of infantry (about 28,000 bayonets) on the ground at
daybreak, and less than 2,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p.
367]</span> horse. He was in a thoroughly dominated position, and it
is hard to see what he could have done, had Wellington strengthened
his left wing with all his cavalry and delivered a vigorous downhill
assault on the unprotected French right. The opportunity for an attack
was so favourable that Wellington’s staff discussed with curiosity the
reasons that might be preventing it, and formed varying hypotheses to
account for his holding back<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432"
class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. As a matter of fact, as his dispatch to
Lord Liverpool explains<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433"
class="fnanchor">[433]</a>, the British Commander-in-Chief was still
hoping for a second Bussaco. He saw that Marmont was not going to
attack till his rear had come up, but hoped that he might do so that
afternoon or next morning, when he had all his men in hand. The daring
way in which the Marshal continued to hold on to an untenable position,
within cannon shot of his enemy’s line, seemed to argue an ultimate
intention to bring on an action.</p>

<p>Nor was Wellington very far out in his ideas: Marmont was in a
state of indecision. When the missing 10,000 men came up he called a
council of war—the regular resort of generals in a difficulty. We have
concerning it only the evidence of Foy, who wrote as follows in his
diary.</p>

<p>‘At dusk on the 21st there was a grand discussion, on the problem
as to whether we should or should not give battle to the English. The
Marshal seemed to have a desire to do so, but a feeble and hesitating
desire. Remembering Vimeiro, Corunna, and Bussaco, I thought that
it would be difficult to beat the English, our superiors in number,
on such a compact position as that which they were occupying. I had
not the first word: I allowed Maucune, Ferey<a id="FNanchor_434"
href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>, and La Martinière to
express their views, before I let them see what I thought. Then Clausel
having protested strongly against fighting, I supported his opinion.
Because we had left a small garrison in the Salamanca forts, we were
not bound to lose 6,000 killed and wounded, and risk the honour of the
army, in order to deliver them. The troops were in good spirits, and
that is excellent for the first assault: but here we should have a long
tough struggle:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span>
I doubted whether we had breath enough to keep it up to the end. In
short, I saw more chances of defeat than victory. I urged that we
ought to keep close to the English, “contain” them, and wait for our
reinforcements; this could be done by manœuvring along the left bank
of the Tormes above and below Salamanca. Clausel and I set forth this
policy from every aspect. The Marshal was displeased: he fancied that
his generals were plotting to wreck his plan: he wanted to redeem
the blunder which he saw that he had made in leaving a garrison in
Salamanca: he dreads the Emperor and the public opinion of the army.
He would have liked a battle, but he had not determination enough to
persist in forcing it on<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435"
class="fnanchor">[435]</a>.’</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, certain that Wellington nearly obtained the
defensive general action that he had desired and expected, and was only
disappointed because Marmont was talked down by his two best divisional
generals. If the Marshal had made his attack, it is clear that his
disaster would have been on a far more complete and awful scale than
the defeat which he was actually to endure on July 22. For he would
have had behind him when repulsed (as he must have been) no friendly
shelter of woods and hills, such as then saved the wrecks of his army,
but a boundless rolling plain, in which routed troops would have been
at the mercy of a cavalry which exceeded their own in the proportion of
seven to five (or slightly more).</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22nd, the British general, who had now kept
his army in position for thirty-six hours on end, began to guess that
he was not to be attacked. Was it worth while to advance, since the
enemy refused to do so? The conditions were by no means so favourable
as at the dawn of the 21st, when Marmont had been short of 10,000
men. But the allied army still possessed a perceptible superiority in
numbers, a stronger cavalry, and a dominating position, from which
it would be easy to deliver a downhill attack under cover of their
artillery.</p>

<p>Wellington, however, made no decisive movement: he threw up some
<i>flèches</i> to cover the batteries in front of the 1st and 7th Divisions,
of which the latter was pushed a little nearer to the Tormes. He
brought up the six heavy howitzers which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span> had been used against the forts, and
placed them on this same right wing of his position. Then he commenced
a partial offensive movement, which was apparently designed to draw
Marmont into a serious bickering, if he were ready to stand. The 7th
Division began to make an advance towards Morisco: the skirmishers of
the Light Brigade of the King’s German Legion moved down, and began
to press in the pickets opposite them, their battalions supporting.
Soon after the 51st and 68th, from the other brigade of the division,
that of De Bernewitz, were ordered to storm a knoll immediately above
Morisco, which formed the most advanced point of the enemy’s line.
Wellington directed Graham to support them with the whole 1st and
Light Divisions, if the enemy should bring up reinforcements and show
fight. But nothing of the kind happened: the two battalions carried the
knoll with a single vigorous rush, losing some 30 killed and wounded<a
id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>. But
the French made no attempt to recapture it, drew back their skirmishing
line, and retired to the village, only 200 yards behind, where they
stood firm, evidently expecting a general attack. It was not delivered:
Wellington had been willing to draw Marmont into a fight, but was not
intending to order an advance of the whole line, and to precipitate a
general offensive battle.</p>

<p>There was no more fighting that day, and next morning the whole
French army had disappeared save some cavalry vedettes. These being
pressed in by Alten’s hussars, it was discovered that Marmont had
gone back six miles, to a line of heights behind the village of Aldea
Rubia, and was there in a defensive position, with his left wing
nearly touching the Tormes near the fords of Huerta. Wellington made
no pursuit: only his cavalry reconnoitred the new French position. He
kept his army on the San Cristobal heights, only moving down Anson’s
brigade of the 4th Division to hold Castellanos, and Halkett’s of the
7th Division to hold Morisco. Hulse’s brigade of the 6th Division
was sent back to Salamanca, as were also Dickson’s six howitzers,
and Clinton was directed to press the siege of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span> the forts—notwithstanding the unhappy
fact that there was scarcely any ammunition left in the batteries.</p>

<p>Marmont had undoubtedly been let off easily by Wellington: yet he
hardly realized it, so filled was his mind with the idea that his
adversary would never take the offensive. His report to King Joseph
shows a sublime ignorance of his late danger. As the document has never
been published and is very short, it may be worth quoting.</p>

<p>‘Having concentrated the greater part of this army on the evening of
the 19th, I marched on Salamanca the same day. I seized some outlying
posts of the enemy, and my army bivouacked within half cannon-shot of
the English. Their army was very well posted, and I did not think it
right to attack yesterday (June 21) without making a reconnaissance of
it. The result of my observations has convinced me that as long as my
own numbers are not <i>at least equal</i> to theirs, I must temporize, and
gain time for the arrival of the troops from the Army of the North,
which General Caffarelli has promised me. If they arrive I shall
be strong enough to take an enterprising course. Till then I shall
manœuvre round Salamanca, so as to try to get the enemy to divide his
army, or to move it out of its position, which will be to my advantage.
The Salamanca forts are making an honourable defence. Since we came
up the enemy has ceased to attack them, so that I have gained time,
and can put off a general action for some days if I think proper<a
id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>.’</p>

<p>Marmont’s plan for ‘manœuvring around Salamanca’ proved (as we shall
see) quite ineffective, and ended within a few days in a definite
retreat, when he found that the succours promised by Caffarelli were
not about to appear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the siege of the Salamanca forts had recommenced, on the
23rd, under the depressing conditions that the artillery had only
60 rounds (15 apiece!) for the four heavy 18-pounders, which were
their effective weapons, and 160 for the six howitzers, which had
hitherto proved almost useless. The two light field-guns (6-pounders)
were also replaced on the first floor of San Bernardo to shell the
enemy’s loopholes—they were no good at all<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> for battering. This time the besiegers
placed one of their heavy guns in the right flanking battery near San
Bernardo, to get an oblique enfilading fire against the gorge of the
San Cayetano fort. The new idea was to leave San Vincente alone, as
too hard a nut to crack with the small supply of shot available, and
to batter the lesser fort from flank and rear with the few rounds
remaining. The entire stock, together with a hundred rounds of shell,
was used up by the afternoon, when no practicable breach had been
made, though the palisades of San Cayetano had been battered down, and
its parapet much injured. Nevertheless Wellington ordered an attempt
to storm (or rather to escalade) the minor fort at 10 p.m. on the
same evening. It was to be carried out by the six light companies of
Bowes’s and Hulse’s brigades of the 6th Division, a force of between
300 and 400 men. ‘The undertaking was difficult, and the men seemed to
feel it,’ observes the official historian of the Peninsular sieges<a
id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.
The major of one of the regiments engaged remarks, ‘the result was
precisely such as most of the officers anticipated—a failure attended
with severe loss of life.’ The storming-column, starting from the
ruins near the left flanking battery, had to charge for the gorge
of San Cayetano, not only under the fire of that work, but with
musketry and artillery from San Vincente taking them in the rear.
The casualties from the first moment were very heavy—many men never
got near the objective, and only two ladders out of twenty were
planted against the fort<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439"
class="fnanchor">[439]</a>. No one tried to ascend them—the project
being obviously useless, and the stormers ran back under cover after
having lost six officers and 120 men, just a third of their numbers<a
id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.
Among the killed was General Bowes, commanding the second brigade
of the division, who had insisted on going forward with his light
companies—though this was evidently not brigadier’s work. Apparently he
thought that his personal influence might enable his men to accomplish
the impossible. He was hit slightly as the column started, but bound
up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span> wound, and
went forward a second time, only to be killed at the very foot of the
ladders, just as his men broke and retired.</p>

<p>This, as all engaged in it agreed, was a very unjustifiable
enterprise; the escalade was impracticable so long as San Vincente was
intact, and able to cover the gorge of San Cayetano with an effective
fire from the rear. The siege now had a second period of lethargy, all
the shot having been used up. It was only on the morning of the 26th,
three days later, that the convoy from Almeida, ordered up on the 20th
by Wellington, arrived with 1,000 rounds carried by mules, and enabled
the battering to begin once more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marmont had been making persistent but ineffective
diversions against Wellington. The advantage of the position to which
he had withdrawn was that it commanded the great bend, or elbow, of
the Tormes, where (at the ford of Huerta) that river turns its general
course from northward to westward. Troops sent across the river
here could threaten Salamanca from the south, and, if in sufficient
strength, might force Wellington to evacuate part of the San Cristobal
position, in order to provide a containing force to prevent them from
communicating with and relieving the besieged forts. The Marshal’s own
statement of his intention<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441"
class="fnanchor">[441]</a> was that he hoped, by manœuvring, to get
Wellington either to divide his army or to leave his strong ground, or
both. He aimed, no doubt, at obtaining the opportunity for a successful
action with some isolated part of Wellington’s force, but was still too
much convinced of the danger of fighting a general action to be ready
to risk much. Moreover he was expecting, from day to day, the 8,000 men
of the Army of the North whom Caffarelli had promised him: and it would
be reckless to give battle before they arrived—if only they were really
coming.</p>

<p>Wellington could see, by his own eyes no less than by the map, for
he rode along Marmont’s new front on the 23rd, that the French position
gave good possibilities for a passage of the elbow of the Tormes at
Huerta: wherefore he detached Bock’s brigade of German Dragoons to the
south of the river, with orders to watch the roads debouching from
the fords, and to act as a detaining force if any hostile cavalry
crossed them. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span>
also threw forward Alten’s hussars to Aldea Lengua, a village and ford
half-way between Cabrerizos and Aldea Rubia, with the object of keeping
a similar close watch on any attempt of Marmont’s to move north of
the river. One brigade of the Light Division came forward to support
Alten—the other was écheloned a little back, on hills above Aldea
Lengua.</p>

<p>On the late evening of the 23rd Marmont sent a squadron or two
across the Huerta fords, which turned back after running into Bock’s
vedettes. This was merely an exploring party to test the practicability
of the passage; but next morning, in a heavy fog, skirmishing fire and
occasional reports of cannon told Wellington that some more important
detachment was across the Tormes, and engaged with the Germans. The
British head-quarters staff rode to the hill above Aldea Lengua, which
commands a wide view over the south bank, and, when the morning vapours
rolled up at 7 o’clock, saw Bock retiring across the rolling plain in
very good order, pressed by a heavy force of all arms—two divisions
of infantry headed by a light cavalry brigade with a horse artillery
battery, which was doing some harm to the two dragoon regiments as they
retired in alternate échelons across the slopes.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was excellent defensive fighting-ground south
of the Tormes, in prolongation of the San Cristobal position north
of it. The ravine and brook<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442"
class="fnanchor">[442]</a> called the Ribera de Pelagarcia with wooded
heights above them, run in front of Santa Marta and its ford, for some
miles southward from the Tormes. There was a similar line of high
ground facing it, with the villages of Pelabravo and Calvarisa de
Ariba on its top, which the French might occupy, but on passing down
from them they would run against a formidable position. Along these
hills, indeed, Wellington’s first line of defence was to be formed a
month later, on the day of the battle of Salamanca. On seeing Bock’s
careful retreat in progress, the Commander-in-Chief ordered Graham
to cross the Tormes at Santa Marta with the 1st and 7th Divisions,
and to occupy the ground in front of him. This was a short move, and
easily accomplished while the French detachment was pushing the German
dragoons slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span>
backward. The 4th and 5th Divisions moved down to the north bank of
the Tormes, ready to follow if Marmont should support his advanced
guard, by sending more men over the Huerta fords. Le Marchant’s heavy
brigade crossed the river with a horse artillery battery, and went to
reinforce Bock, whom the French could now only push in by bringing
forward infantry. Their advance continued as far as the village of
Calvarisa de Abaxo, and a little beyond, where the whole 9,000 or
10,000 men deployed, as if intending to attack Graham. But just as
observers on the Aldea Lengua heights were beginning to think that
serious fighting was probable<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443"
class="fnanchor">[443]</a>, the whole fell back into column of march,
and, retiring to Huerta covered by their <i>chasseurs</i>, recrossed the
river.</p>

<p>The state of affairs at nightfall was just what it had been at
dawn. Graham and Le Marchant went back to their old ground north of
the river, and south of it cavalry alone was left—this time Alten’s
brigade, for Bock’s had had a heavy day, and needed rest. So ended a
spectacular but almost bloodless manœuvre—the German dragoons lost
three killed and two wounded: the French light horse probably no
more.</p>

<p>In a dispatch written the same night Marmont frankly owns that he
was foiled by Wellington’s counter-move. This hitherto unpublished
document is worth quoting. It is addressed to General Caffarelli,
and runs as follows<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444"
class="fnanchor">[444]</a>. ‘The movement which I have made toward
Salamanca has caused the enemy to suspend his attack on the forts
of that town. [An error, as it was not the movement but the lack of
ammunition which stopped the bombardment.] This consideration, and the
way in which I found him posted to keep me off, and not least your
assurance that your powerful reinforcements would reach me very soon,
have determined me to suspend the attack which I was about to deliver
against him. I stop here with the object of gaining time, and in the
expectation of your arrival.’ From this it is clear that if Graham had
not been found so well posted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p.
375]</span> in a position where he could readily be reinforced from
San Cristobal, Marmont would have followed up his advanced guard with
the rest of his army, and have struck at Salamanca from the South. But
finding the ground on the left bank of the river just as unfavourable
to him as that on the north, he gave up the game and retired. He risked
a serious check, for Wellington might have ordered Graham to follow and
attack the retreating divisions, who would have had great difficulty
in recrossing the Tormes without loss, if they had been pursued and
attacked while jammed at the fords. But Wellington was still in his
defensive mood, and took no risks, contented to have foiled most
effectively his enemy’s manœuvre.</p>

<p>On the 25th Marmont remained stationary, waiting for further advices
from Caffarelli, which failed to come to hand. Nor did Wellington make
any move, save that of sending orders that the siege of the forts was
to be pressed as early and as vigorously as possible. The guns were
back in their batteries, waiting for the ammunition which was yet to
appear. All that could be done without shot was to push forward a
trench along the bottom of the ravine between San Vincente and the
other two forts, to cut off communication between them. The French
fired fiercely at the workers, where they could look down into the
ravine, and killed some of them. But there was much ‘dead ground’ which
could not be reached from any point in the forts, and by dawn on the
26th the trench was far advanced, and a picket was lodged safely in it,
close under the gorge of San Cayetano.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th the convoy of powder and shot from
Almeida reached the front, and at three in the afternoon the besiegers
recommenced their fire. This time no guns were placed in the original
battery opposite the north front of San Vincente; the four 18-pounders
all went into the right flank attack, and were concentrated on the
gorge of San Cayetano. Four of the howitzers were placed in the left
flank battery, near the College of Cuenca, and directed to fire red-hot
shot into the roof and upper story of San Vincente. The field-guns in
San Bernardo, aided by one howitzer, took up their old work of trying
to keep down the fire of the forts.</p>

<p>The battering in of the gorge of San Cayetano made consider<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span>able progress, but the
most effective work was that of the red-hot shot, which before night
had set the tower of San Vincente and several points of its roof in
flames. By heroic exertions the garrison succeeded in extinguishing
them, but the besiegers’ fire was kept up all night, and from time to
time new conflagrations burst out. The governor afterwards informed
the British engineers that eighteen separate outbreaks were kept down
within the twenty-four hours before his surrender<a id="FNanchor_445"
href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>. The fort was very
inflammable, owing to the immense amount of timber that had been used
for casemating, traverses, barricades, and parapets, inside its walls.
Still it was holding out at daybreak, though the garrison was nearly
exhausted: the governor signalled to Marmont that he could not resist
for more than three days—a sad over-estimate of his power, as was to be
shown in a few hours. As a subsidiary aid to the work of the guns two
mines were commenced, one from the ravine, destined to burrow under San
Cayetano, the other from the cliff by the river, intended to reach La
Merced. But neither was fated to be used, other means sufficing.</p>

<p>After four hours’ pounding on the morning of the 27th, the gorge of
San Cayetano had been battered into a real and very practicable breach,
while a new fire had broken out in San Vincente, larger than any one
which had preceded it. It reached the main store of gabions and planks
within the fort, and threatened the powder magazine. The garrison were
evidently flinching from their guns, as the counter-fire from the
place, hitherto very lively, began to flag, and the whole building was
wrapped in smoke.</p>

<p>Thereupon Wellington ordered San Cayetano to be stormed for the
second time. The column charged with the operation crept forward along
the trench at the bottom of the ravine, fairly well covered till it had
reached the spot immediately below the gorge of the fort. Just as the
forlorn hope was about to start out of the trench, a white flag was
shown from the breach. The captain commanding in San Cayetano asked for
two hours’ truce, to enable him to communicate with his chief in San
Vincente, promising to surrender at the end of that time. Wellington
offered him five minutes to march out, if he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span> wished to preserve his garrison’s lives
and baggage. As the Frenchmen continued to haggle and argue, he was
told to take down his white flag, as the assault was about to be
delivered. When the stormers ran in, San Cayetano made practically no
defence, though a few shots were fired, which caused six casualties
in the assaulting column: the greater part of the garrison threw down
their muskets and made no resistance.</p>

    SALAMANCA FORTS
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">At the same moment the white flag went up on San
Vincente also: here the conflagration was now burning up so fiercely
that the French had been able to spare no attention for the
storming-party that captured San Cayetano. The governor, Duchemin,
asked for three hours’ suspension of arms, and made a proposal of terms
of surrender. Wellington, here as at the smaller fort, refused to grant
time, as he thought that the fire would be subdued and the defence
prolonged, if he allowed hours to be wasted in negotiations. He sent
in the same ultimatum as at San Cayetano—five minutes for the garrison
to march out, and they should have all the ‘honours of war’ and their
baggage intact. Duchemin, like his subordinate, returned a dilatory
message, but while his white flag was still flying, the 9th Caçadores
pushed up out of the ravine and entered the battery on the east side of
the work. They were not fired on, no one in San Vincente being prepared
to continue the defence, and the French standard came down without
further resistance.</p>

<p>Not quite 600 unwounded men of the garrison were captured.
They had lost just 200 during the siege, including 14 officers<a
id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>. The
casualties among the British were, as might have been expected, much
heavier, largely owing to the unjustifiable assault of June 23rd. They
amounted to 5 officers and 94 men killed, and 29 officers and 302 men
wounded. A considerable store of clothing, much powder, and 36 guns
of all sorts were found in the three forts. The powder was made over
to Carlos de España, one of whose officers, having moved it into the
town on the 7th July, contrived to explode many barrels, which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span> killed several soldiers
and twenty citizens, besides wrecking some houses<a id="FNanchor_447"
href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. The three forts
were destroyed with care, when they had been stripped of all their
contents.</p>

<p>The fall of the Salamanca forts happened just in time to prevent
Marmont from committing himself to a serious offensive operation for
their succour. It will be remembered that, on June 24th, he had used
the plea that Caffarelli’s troops must be with him, ere many days had
passed, as a justification for not pushing on to attack the British
divisions in front of Santa Marta. And this expectation was reasonable,
in view of that general’s last dispatch from Vittoria of June 14th<a
id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>,
which spoke of his appearance with 8,000 men as certain and imminent.
On the 26th, however, the Marshal received another letter from the Army
of the North, couched in a very different tone, which upset all his
plans. Caffarelli, writing on the 20th, reported the sudden arrival
on the Biscay coast of Sir Home Popham’s fleet, whose strength he
much exaggerated. In co-operation with the English, Longa, Renovales,
and Porlier had all come down from their mountains, and Bilbao was in
danger from their unexpected and simultaneous appearance. It would
probably be necessary to march to drive off the ‘7th Army’ and the
British expedition without delay. At any rate the transference of any
infantry towards the Douro for the succour of the Army of Portugal had
become impossible for the moment. The brigade of light cavalry and
the guns might still be sent, but the infantry division had become
indispensable elsewhere. ‘I am sorry,’ ended Caffarelli, ‘but I could
not have foreseen this development, and when I spoke of marching
towards you I was far from suspecting that it could arise.’</p>

<p>This epistle changed the whole aspect of affairs: if the infantry
division from Vittoria had been diverted into Biscay for an indefinite
period, and if even the cavalry and guns (an insignificant force so
far as numbers went, yet useful to an army short of horse) had not
even started on June 20th, it was clear that not a single man would be
available from the North for many days. Meanwhile the governor of the
forts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span> signalled at
dawn on the 27th that seventy-two hours was the limit of his power of
resistance. Thereupon Marmont came to the desperate resolve to attempt
the relief of San Vincente with no more than his own 40,000 men. He
tells us that he intended to move by the south side of the Tormes,
crossing not at Huerta (as on the 24th) but at Alba de Tormes, seven
miles higher up, where he had a small garrison in the old castle, which
protected the bridge. This move would have brought him precisely on to
the ground where he ultimately fought the disastrous battle of July
22nd. He would have met Wellington with 7,000 men less than he brought
to the actual battle that was yet to come, while the Anglo-Portuguese
army was practically the same in July as it was in June<a
id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>. The
result could not have been doubtful—and Marmont knew that he was taking
a serious risk. But he did not fathom its full danger, since he was
filled with an unjustifiable confidence in his adversary’s aversion
to battle, and thought that he might be manœuvred and bullied out of
his position, by a move against his communications<a id="FNanchor_450"
href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. He would have
found out his error in front of the Arapiles on June 29th if he had
persevered.</p>

<p>But he did not persevere: in the morning of June 27 the firing at
Salamanca ceased, and a few hours later it was known that the forts had
fallen. Having now no longer any reason for taking risks, the Marshal
changed his whole plan, and resolved to remove himself in haste from
Wellington’s neighbourhood, and to take up a defensive position till
he should receive reinforcements. Two courses were open to him—the
first was to retire due eastward toward Arevalo, and put himself in
communication, by Avila and Segovia, with the Army of the Centre and
Madrid. The second was to retire north-eastward toward Valladolid, and
to go behind the strong defensive line of the Douro. Taking this line
the Marshal would sacrifice his touch with Madrid and the South, but
would be certain of picking up the reinforcement under Bonnet which he
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> expecting from
the Asturias, and would also be able to receive with security whatever
succour Caffarelli might send—even if it turned out to be no more than
cavalry and guns.</p>

<p>This alternative he chose, probably with wisdom, for in a position
on the Douro he threatened Wellington’s flank if he should advance
farther eastward, and protected the central parts of the kingdom
of Leon from being overrun by the Army of Galicia and Silveira’s
Portuguese, who would have had no containing force whatever in front of
them if he had kept south of the Douro and linked himself with Madrid.
His retreat, commenced before daybreak on the 28th, took him behind
the Guarena river that night: on the 29th he crossed the Trabancos,
and rested for a day after two forced marches. On the 30th he passed
the Zapardiel, and reached Rueda, close to the Douro, on the following
morning. From thence he wrote to King Joseph a dispatch which explains
sufficiently well all his designs: it is all the more valuable because
its details do not entirely bear out the version of his plans which he
gives in his <i>Mémoires</i>.</p>

<p>‘The Salamanca forts,’ he said, ‘having surrendered, there was no
reason for lingering on the Tormes; it was better to fall back on his
reinforcements. If he had not done so, he would have been himself
attacked, for Wellington was preparing to strike, and pursued promptly.
He had detached one division [Foy] towards Toro and the Lower Douro to
keep off Silveira, who had passed that river at Zamora. Moreover the
Galicians had blockaded Astorga, and crossed the Orbigo. He felt that
he could defend the line of the Douro with confidence, being aided by
the line of fortified posts along it—Zamora, Toro, and Tordesillas.
But to take the offensive against Wellington he must have 1,500 more
cavalry and 7,000 more infantry than he actually had in hand—since the
Anglo-Portuguese army was nearly 50,000 strong, and included 5,000
English horse.’ This reinforcement was precisely what Caffarelli had
promised, but by the 28th not one man of the Army of the North had
reached Valladolid. ‘If the general can trump up some valid excuse
for not sending me the infantry, there is none for keeping back the
cavalry—which is useless among his mountains—or the artillery, which
lies idle at Burgos.’ Would it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p.
381]</span> not be possible for the Army of the Centre to lend the
Army of Portugal Treillard’s division of dragoons from the valley
of the Tagus, since Caffarelli sent nothing? If only the necessary
reinforcements, 1,500 horse and 7,000 foot, came to hand, the Army
of Portugal could take the offensive with a certainty of success<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>;
in eight days Wellington’s designs could be foiled, and Salamanca
could be recovered. But without that succour the Marshal must keep to
the defensive behind the Douro—’I can combat the course of events,
but cannot master them<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452"
class="fnanchor">[452]</a>.’</p>

<p>This interesting dispatch explains all that followed. Marmont was
prepared to fight whenever he could show a rough numerical equality
with Wellington’s army. He obtained it a few days later, by the arrival
of Bonnet with his 6,500 infantry, and the increase of his cavalry by
800 or 900 sabres owing to measures hereafter to be described. On July
15th he had got together nearly 50,000 men of all arms, and at once
took the offensive, according to the programme which he had laid down.
It is, therefore, unfair to him to say that he declared himself unable
to fight till he should have got reinforcements either from Caffarelli
or from Madrid, and then (in despite of his declaration) attacked
Wellington without having received them. He may have been presumptuous
in acting as he did, but at least he gave his Commander-in-Chief fair
notice, a fortnight beforehand, as to his intentions. It was the
misfortune of the French that some of their dispatches miscarried,
owing to the activity of the guerrilleros, while others came to
hand very late. Marmont and King Joseph—as we shall see—were very
imperfectly and intermittently informed as to each other’s doings.
But the Marshal cannot reasonably be accused of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span> betraying or deluding the King out
of jealousy or blind ambition. When he had collected a force very
nearly equal to Wellington’s in numbers, and far superior in national
homogeneity, he cannot be blamed over-much for attacking a foe whose
fighting spirit and initiative he much undervalued. That his conception
of Wellington’s character and capacity was hopelessly wrong cannot be
denied: the estimate was to prove his ruin. But it had not been formed
without much observation and experiment: after what he had seen on
the Caya, and at Aldea da Ponte, and recently on the heights of San
Cristobal, he thought he could take liberties with his opponent. He was
to be undeceived in a very rude fashion before July was out.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER V">SECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER V</h3>
  <p class="subh3">MARMONT TAKES THE OFFENSIVE. JULY 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On July</span> 2nd Wellington had arrived at
the end of the first stage of his campaign. He had cleared the French
out of the whole of southern Leon as far as the Douro, had taken the
Salamanca forts, and had beaten off with ease Marmont’s attempts to
meddle with him. All this had been accomplished with the loss of
less than 500 men. But the success, though marked, was not decisive,
since the enemy’s army had not been beaten in the open field, but
only manœuvred out of the considerable region that it had evacuated.
The most tangible advantage secured was that Marmont had been cut
off from Madrid and the Army of the Centre: he could now communicate
with King Joseph only by the circuitous line through Segovia. All
the guerrilleros of Castile, especially the bands of Saornil and
Principe, were thrown on the Segovia and Avila roads, where they served
Wellington excellently, for they captured most of the dispatches which
were passing between King Joseph and Marmont, who were really out of
touch with each other after the Marshal’s retreat from the Tormes on
June 27th.</p>

<p>But till Marmont had been beaten in action nothing was settled,
and Wellington had been disappointed of his hope that the Army of
Portugal would attack him in position, and allow him to deal with it
in the style of Bussaco. The Marshal had retired behind the Douro
with his host intact: it was certain that he would be joined there by
Bonnet’s division from the Asturias, and very possible that he might
also receive succour from the Army of the North. The junction of Bonnet
would give him a practical equality in numbers with the British army:
any considerable reinforcement from Caffarelli would make him superior
in force. And there was still a chance that other French armies
might intervene, though hitherto there were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span> no signs of it. For it was only during
the first fortnight of the campaign that Wellington could reckon on
having to deal with his immediate adversary alone. He was bound to have
that much start, owing to the wide dispersion of the French, and their
difficulty in communicating with each other. But as the weeks wore on,
and the enemy became more able to grasp the situation, there was a
growing possibility that outlying forces might be brought up towards
the Douro. If Marmont had only been defeated on June 21st this would
have mattered little: and Wellington must have regretted more and more
each day that he had not taken the obvious opportunity, and attacked
the Army of Portugal when it placed itself, incomplete and in a poor
position, beneath the heights of San Cristobal.</p>

<p>Now, however, since Marmont had got away intact, everything depended
on the working of the various diversions which had been prepared to
distract the other French armies. One of them, Sir Home Popham’s, had
succeeded to admiration, and had so scared Caffarelli that not a man
of the Army of the North was yet in motion toward the Douro. And this
fortunate expedition was to continue effective: for another three weeks
Marmont got no succours from the army that was supposed to constitute
his supporting force by the instructions of the Emperor and of King
Joseph. But Wellington—not having the gift of prophecy, though he could
see further into the fog of war than other men—was unable to rely with
certainty on Caffarelli’s continued abstinence from interference. As
to Soult, there were as yet no signs of any trouble from Andalusia.
The Duke of Dalmatia had somewhat reinforced D’Erlon’s corps in
Estremadura, but not to such an extent as threatened any real danger to
Hill, who reported that he could keep D’Erlon in check on the Albuera
position, and was not certain that he might not be able to attack
him at advantage—a move for which he had his chief’s permission<a
id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>.
If only Wellington had been fortunate enough to receive some of
Soult’s letters to King Joseph, written in the second half of June,
he would have been much reassured: for the Marshal was (as we shall
see) refusing in the most insubordinate style to carry out the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span> orders sent him to move
troops northward. Two minor pieces of intelligence from the South
were of no primary importance—though vexatious enough—one was that
Ballasteros had ventured on a battle at Bornos on June 1, and got well
beaten: but his army was not destroyed. The second was that General
Slade had suffered a discreditable check at Maguilla on June 11th in a
cavalry combat with Lallemand’s dragoons. But neither of these events
had much influence on Soult’s general conduct at the time, as we shall
show in the proper place.</p>

<p>There remained one quarter from which Wellington had received
information that was somewhat disturbing. An intercepted letter from
King Joseph to D’Erlon showed that the latter had been directed to move
towards the Tagus, and that the King himself was evidently thinking
of bringing succour to Marmont, so far as his modest means allowed<a
id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>. But
since this projected operation seemed to depend on assistance being
granted by Soult, and since it was doubtful in the highest degree
whether Soult would give it, Wellington was not without hopes that it
might come to nothing. ‘I have requested the Empecinado,’ he writes
to Lord Liverpool, ‘to alarm the King for the safety of his situation
about Madrid, and I hope that Marshal Soult will find ample employment
for his troops in the blockade of Cadiz, the continued operations of
General Ballasteros, and those in Estremadura of Lieut.-General Hill,
whose attention I have called to the probable march of this corps of
the Army of the South through Estremadura.’ As a matter of fact Soult
prevented D’Erlon from giving any help to the King or Marmont; but a
contingency was to arise of which Wellington, on July 1st, could have
no expectation—viz. that, though refused all help from the South,
Joseph might come to the desperate but most soldier-like determination
to march with his own little army alone to the Douro, in order to
bring to bear such influence as he possessed on what was obviously a
critical moment in the war. The King and Jourdan<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span> were the only men in Spain who showed a
true appreciation of the crisis: but they made their move too late: the
fault was undoubtedly Soult’s alone. However, on July 1st, Wellington
was justified in doubting whether any danger would arise on the side
of Madrid. Joseph could not move the Army of the Centre to the Douro,
without risking his capital and abandoning all New Castile. As late
as July 11th Wellington suspected that he would not make this extreme
sacrifice, but would rather push a demonstration down the Tagus to
alarm central Portugal, a hypothesis which did not much alarm him<a
id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. The
King and Jourdan knew better than to make this indecisive move, and
marched where their 14,000 men might have turned the whole course of
the campaign—but marched too late.</p>

<p>There was still a chance that Suchet might be helping the King—this
depended entirely on an unknown factor in the game, the diversion
which Lord William Bentinck had promised to execute on the coast of
Catalonia. If it had begun to work, as it should have done, by the
second half of June, there was little chance that any troops from the
eastern side of Spain would interfere in the struggle on the Douro. But
no information of recent date was yet forthcoming: it was not till July
14th that the vexatious news arrived that Lord William was faltering
in his purpose, and thinking of plans for diverting his expeditionary
force to Italy.</p>

<p>The situation, therefore, when Marmont went behind the Douro on
July 1st, had many uncertain points: there were several dangerous
possibilities, but nothing had yet happened to make ultimate success
improbable. On the whole the most disappointing factor was the conduct
of the Army of Galicia. It will be remembered that Wellington had
arranged for a double diversion on Marmont’s flank and rear. Silveira,
with the militia of the Tras-os-Montes and D’Urban’s Portuguese cavalry
brigade, was to cross the Esla and besiege Zamora. Santocildes, with
the Army of Galicia, had been directed to attack Astorga with part of
his force, but to bring the main body forward to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span> the Esla and overrun the plains of
northern Leon. Silveira had but a trifling force, and the task
allotted to him was small: but on July 1st he had not yet reached
Zamora with his infantry, and was only at Carvajales on the Esla<a
id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>. On
the other hand D’Urban’s cavalry had pushed boldly forward in front of
him, had swept the whole north bank of the Douro as far as Toro, and
reported that all the French garrisons save Astorga, Zamora, and Toro
had been drawn in—that Benavente, Leon, and all the northern plain were
unoccupied. On July 2 D’Urban was at Castronuevo, north of Toro, right
in the rear of Marmont’s flank—a very useful position, since it enabled
him to keep up communication between Silveira and the Galicians, as
well as to report any movement of the French right. Moreover, though
his force was very small, only 800 sabres, it was enough to prevent
any foraging parties from Marmont’s rear from exploiting the resources
of the north bank of the Douro. Some such appeared, but were driven
in at once, so that the Marshal had to live on his magazines and
the villages actually within his lines: in the end these resources
would be exhausted, and the old choice—starvation or dispersion—would
once more be presented to the Army of Portugal<a id="FNanchor_457"
href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.</p>

<p>But as a military body neither D’Urban’s 800 horse nor Silveira’s
4,000 militia had any threatening power against Marmont’s rear. They
might almost be neglected, while the real pressure which Wellington had
intended to apply in this quarter was not forthcoming. He had hoped
that, by the time that he and Marmont were at close quarters, the
Army of Galicia would have been taking a useful part in the campaign.
It was not that he intended to use it as a fighting force: but if it
could have appeared in the French rear 15,000 strong, it would have
compelled Marmont to make such a large detachment<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span> for the purpose of ‘containing’ it,
that he would have been left in a marked numerical inferiority on the
Douro.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Galicians moved late, in small numbers, and
with marked timidity. They exercised no influence whatever on the
course of the campaign, either in June or in July. Yet after Bonnet
evacuated the Asturias and went off eastward on June 15th, the Army
of Galicia had no field-force of any kind in front of it. The only
French left in its neighbourhood were the 1,500 men<a id="FNanchor_458"
href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> who formed the garrison
of Astorga. Castaños, who had moved up to Santiago in June, and assumed
command, did not take the field himself, but handed over the charge
of the troops at the front to Santocildes. The latter sat down in
front of Astorga with his main body, and only pushed forward a weak
division under Cabrera to Benavente, where it was still too remote
from Marmont to cause him any disquiet. The siege of Astorga was only
a blockade till July 2nd, as no battering-train was brought up till
that date. First Abadia, and later Castaños had pleaded that they had
no means for a regular siege, and it was not till Sir Howard Douglas
pointed out a sufficient store of heavy guns in the arsenal of Corunna,
that Castaños began to scrape together the battering-train that
ultimately reached Astorga<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459"
class="fnanchor">[459]</a>. But this was not so much the weak point in
the operations of the Galician army, as the fact that, of 15,000 men
brought together on the Orbigo, only 3,800 were pushed forward to the
Esla, while the unnecessarily large remainder conducted a leisurely
siege of the small garrison of Astorga. Wellington had reckoned on
having an appreciable force, 10,000 or 12,000 men, at the front,
molesting Marmont’s flank; this would have forced the Marshal to make
a large detachment to keep it off. But not a man appeared on the
east bank of the Esla, and the operations of D’Urban’s small brigade
were of far more service to the main army than that of the whole of
the Galicians. Marmont ignored the presence of the few thousand men
pushed forward to Benavente, and was justified in so doing. Meanwhile
Santo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[p. 389]</span>cildes, with
an optimism that proved wholly unjustifiable, sent messages that
Astorga would be taken within a few days, and that he would then move
forward with his main body. As a matter of fact the place held out till
the 18th of August.</p>

<p>Wellington, therefore, was building on a false hypothesis when
he wrote to Lord Bathurst, on July 7, that he was surveying all the
fords of the Douro, and waiting till the river should have fallen
a little and made them more practicable. ‘By that time I hope that
the Army of Galicia under General Santocildes will have been able to
advance, the siege of Astorga having been brought to a conclusion<a
id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>.’
Two days later he added, ‘it would not answer to cross the river
at all in its present state, unless we should be certain of having
the co-operation of the Galician troops<a id="FNanchor_461"
href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>.’ His delay in making
an attempt to force the line of the Douro, therefore, may be attributed
in the main to the tiresome conduct of Santocildes, who played to him
much the same part that Caffarelli played to Marmont.</p>

<p>While remaining in this waiting posture, Wellington placed his
troops opposite the various passages of the Douro, on a line of some
fifteen miles. His left, consisting of the 3rd Division, Pack’s and
Bradford’s Portuguese, and Carlos de España’s Spaniards, with Le
Marchant’s and Bock’s heavy dragoons, lay near the point where the
Trabancos falls into the Douro, holding the ford of Pollos, where the
favourable configuration of the ground enabled them to be sure of the
passage, the enemy’s line being perforce drawn back to some distance
on the north bank. It was always open to Wellington to use this ford,
when he should determine on a general advance. The Light, 4th, 5th,
and 6th Divisions, forming the right wing, lay opposite Tordesillas,
with Rueda and La Seca behind them. Their front was covered by Alten’s
cavalry brigade, their right (or outer) flank by Anson’s. The reserve
was formed by the 1st and 7th Divisions quartered at Medina del Campo,
ten miles to the rear. The whole could be assembled for an offensive or
a defensive move in a day’s march.</p>

<p>Marmont was drawn up, to face the attack that he expected, in an
almost equally close and concentrated formation: his front, extending
from the junction of the Pisuerga with the Douro<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span> near Simancas on his left, to the ground
opposite the ford of Pollos on his right, was very thickly held<a
id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>;
but on the 5th he rightly conceived doubts as to whether it would not
be easy for Wellington to turn his western flank, by using the ford
of Castro Nuño and other passages down-stream from Pollos. He then
detached Foy’s division to Toro and the neighbourhood, to guard against
such a danger: but this was still an insufficient provision, since
Toro is fifteen miles from Pollos, and a single division of 5,000 men
would have to watch rather than defend such a length of river-line, if
it were attacked in force. Therefore when Bonnet, so long expected in
vain, arrived from the North on July 7th, Marmont placed him in this
portion of his line, for the assistance of Foy. He still retained six
divisions massed around Tordesillas, whose unbroken bridge gave him
a secure access to the southern bank of the Douro. With this mass of
35,000 men in hand, he could meet Wellington with a solid body, if the
latter crossed the Douro at or below Pollos. Or he might equally well
take the more daring step of assuming a counter-offensive, and marching
from Tordesillas on Salamanca against his adversary’s communications,
if the allies threatened his own by passing the river and moving on
Valladolid.</p>

<p>A word to explain the tardiness of Bonnet’s arrival in comparison
with the earliness of his start is perhaps required. He had evacuated
Oviedo and Gijon and his other posts in the Asturias as early as June
14th, the actual day on which Wellington commenced his offensive
campaign. This he did not in consequence of Marmont’s orders,
which only reached him when he had begun to move, but on his own
responsibility. He had received correct information as to the massing
of the allied army round Ciudad Rodrigo, and of the forward movement
of the Galicians towards Astorga. He knew of the dispersed state of
Marmont’s host, and saw the danger to himself. Should the Marshal
concentrate about Salamanca, he could never join him, if the whole Army
of Galicia threw itself between. Wherefore not only did he resolve to
retreat at once, but he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p.
391]</span> not move by the pass of Pajares and Leon—the obvious route
to rejoin the Army of Portugal. For fear that he might be intercepted,
he took the coast-road, picking up the small garrisons that he had
placed in one or two small ports. He reached Santander on the 22nd,
not molested so much as he might have been by the bands of Porlier and
Longa (whose haunts he was passing), because the bulk of them had gone
off to help in Sir Home Popham’s raid on Biscay. From Santander he
turned inland, passed Reynosa, in the heart of the Cantabrian Sierras,
on the 24th June, and arrived at Aguilar del Campo, the first town
in the province of Palencia, on the 29th. From thence he had a long
march of seven days in the plains, before he reached Valladolid on the
6th, and reported himself at Marmont’s head-quarters on the 7th of
July. He brought with him a strong division of 6,500 infantry, a light
field-battery, and a single squadron of Chasseurs—even 100 sabres<a
id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
were a welcome reinforcement to Marmont’s under-horsed army. It was
an odd fact that Bonnet’s division had never before met the English
in battle, though one of its regiments had seen them during the last
days of Sir John Moore’s retreat in January 1809<a id="FNanchor_464"
href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>. For the three years
since that date they had always been employed in the Asturias.</p>

<p>The arrival of Bonnet brought up the total of Marmont’s infantry
to 43,000 men, and his guns to 78. The cavalry still remained the
weak point: but by a high-handed and unpopular measure the Marshal
succeeded, during his stay on the Douro, in procuring nearly 1,000
horses for the dismounted dragoons who were encumbering his dépôt
at Valladolid. In the French, as in the British, Peninsular army it
had become common for many of the junior officers of the infantry
to provide themselves with a riding-horse; most captains and many
lieutenants had them. And their seniors, <i>chefs de bataillon</i> and
colonels, habitually had several horses more than they were entitled
to. Marmont took the heroic measure of proclaiming that he should
enforce the regulations, and that all unauthorized horses were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span> confiscated. He paid,
however, a valuation for each beast on a moderate scale—otherwise the
act would have been intolerable. In this way, including some mounts
requisitioned from doctors, commissaries, and suttlers, about 1,000
horses in all were procured. The number of cavalry fit for the field
had gone up by July 15th from about 2,200 to 3,200—a total which was
only 300 less than Wellington’s full strength of British sabres. It
occurs to the casual observer that the horses, having never been
trained to squadron drill or to act in mass, must have been difficult
to manage, even though the riders were competent horsemen. This may
have something to do with the very ineffective part played by the
French cavalry in the next fortnight’s campaigning.</p>

<p>A quaint anecdote of the time shows us General Taupin, an old
Revolutionary veteran, with all the officers of his brigade called
together in a village church. ‘He ascended the pulpit and thundered
against the abuse of horses in the infantry: he would make an end of
all baggage carried on mules or asses, but most especially of the
officers’ riding-horses. “Gentlemen,” he cried, “in 1793 we were
allowed a haversack as our only baggage, a stone as our only pillow.”
Well—it was a long time since 1793: we were in 1812, and the speaker,
this old and gallant soldier, had <i>six</i> baggage mules himself<a
id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.’</p>

<p>During the first ten days after the deadlock on the Douro began,
the French were much puzzled by Wellington’s refusal to continue his
advance. Foy, the ablest of them, noted in his diary that he must
conclude either that the enemy was not numerous enough to take the
offensive—his strength might have been over-valued—or else that he was
waiting for Hill to bring up his corps from Estremadura. This last
idea, indeed, was running in the brains of many French strategists:
it obsessed Jourdan and King Joseph at Madrid, who were well aware
that Hill, marching by Alcantara and the passes of the Sierra de Gata,
could have got to the Douro in half the time that it would have taken
his opponent, D’Erlon, who would have had to move by Toledo, Madrid,
and Segovia. But the simple explanation is to be found in Wellington’s
dispatch to Lord Bathurst of July 13. ‘It is obvious that we could
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span> cross the Douro
without sustaining great loss, and could not fight a general action
under circumstances of greater disadvantage.... The enemy’s numbers are
equal, if not superior, to ours: they have in their position thrice
the amount of artillery that we have, and we are superior in cavalry
alone—which arm (it is probable) could not be used in the sort of
attack we should have to make<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466"
class="fnanchor">[466]</a>.’ He then proceeds to demonstrate the
absolute necessity of bringing forward the Army of Galicia against
Marmont’s rear. Its absence was the real cause of the deadlock in
which he found himself involved. All offensive operations were
postponed—meanwhile the enemy might receive reinforcements and attack,
since he had not been attacked. ‘But I still hope that I shall be able
to retain, at the close of this campaign, those acquisitions which we
made at its commencement.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marmont, having had a fortnight to take stock of his
position, and having received reinforcements which very nearly
reached the figure that he had named to King Joseph as the minimum
which would enable him to take the offensive, was beginning to get
restless. He had now realized that he would get no practical assistance
from Caffarelli, who still kept sending him letters exaggerating
the terrors of Sir Home Popham’s raid on Biscay. They said that
there were six ships of the line engaged in it, and that there was
a landing-force of British regulars: Bonnet’s evacuation of the
Asturias had allowed all the bands of Cantabria to turn themselves
loose on Biscay—Bilbao was being attacked—and so forth. This being
so, it was only possible to send a brigade of cavalry and a horse
artillery battery—anything more was useless to ask<a id="FNanchor_467"
href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>. This was written on
June 26th, but by July 11th not even the cavalry brigade had started
from Vittoria, as was explained by a subsequent letter, which only
reached Marmont after he had already started on an offensive campaign<a
id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. As
a matter of fact, Caffarelli’s meagre contribution of 750 sabres<a
id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span> battery
actually got off on July 16th<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470"
class="fnanchor">[470]</a>. Marmont may be pardoned for having believed
that it would never start at all, when it is remembered that a month
had elapsed since he first asked for aid, and that every two days he
had been receiving dispatches of excuse, but no reinforcements. He had
no adequate reason for thinking that even the trifling force which did
in the end start out would ever arrive.</p>

<p>Nor, as he demonstrates clearly enough in his defence of his
operations, had he any more ground for believing that Joseph and
Jourdan would bring him help from Madrid. They resolved to do so in
the end, and made a vigorous effort to collect as large a force as
was possible. But the announcement of their intention was made too
late to profit Marmont. The dispatch conveying it was sent off from
Madrid only on July 9th<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471"
class="fnanchor">[471]</a>, and never reached the Marshal at all,
for the two copies of it, sent by separate messengers, were both
captured by guerrilleros between Madrid and Valladolid, and came into
Wellington’s instead of into Marmont’s hands. This was a consequence
of the insecurity of the communication via Segovia, the only one route
open when the Army of Portugal retired behind the Douro. On July 12th
the last piece of intelligence from Madrid which Marmont had received
was a dispatch from Jourdan dated June 30th—it had taken twelve days
to get 150 miles, which shows the shifts to which its bearer had been
exposed. This letter is so important, as showing what the King and
Jourdan opined at the moment, that its gist is worth giving.</p>

<p>Jourdan begins by complaining that on June 30 the last dispatch
from the Army of Portugal to hand was sixteen days old, of the date
of June 14th. It is clear, then, that no copies of the reports sent
by Marmont on June 22 and June 24 had got to Madrid—a circumstance
to be explained by the fact that Wellington had them instead of
their destined recipient<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472"
class="fnanchor">[472]</a>. Jourdan then proceeds to say that he is
informed that Wellington has 50,000 men, but only 18,000 of them
British. ‘The King thinks that if this is so, you are strong enough to
beat his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span> army, and
would like to know the motives which have prevented you from taking
the offensive. He charges me to invite you to explain them by express
messenger.’ In the South it was known that Hill, with 18,000 men,
was advancing on June 18th against D’Erlon. That officer was to be
reinforced from Seville, and was probably at close quarters with Hill.
The King had sent orders that D’Erlon was to move northward into the
valley of the Tagus, if Hill marched up to join Wellington. But, it
being probable that the order would not be very promptly executed, ‘his
Majesty would like you to take advantage of the moment, when Wellington
has not all his forces in hand, to fight him. The King has asked for
troops from Marshal Suchet, but they will never be sent. All that His
Majesty can do at present is to reinforce the garrison of Segovia, and
order its governor, General Espert, to help the garrison of Avila, if
necessary, and to supply it with food.’</p>

<p>This letter, which clearly gives no hope of immediate help for the
Army of Portugal from Madrid, and which might be taken as a direct
incitement to bring Wellington to action at once, must be read in
conjunction with the last epistle that Marmont had received from the
same quarter. This was a letter of the King’s dated June 18. The
important paragraph of it runs as follows:—</p>

<p>‘If General Hill has remained with his 18,000 men on the left
(south) bank of the Tagus, you ought to be strong enough to beat the
English army, more especially if you have received any reinforcements
from the Army of the North. You must choose your battlefield, and make
your best dispositions. But if Hill joins the main English army, I
fancy they are too strong for you. In that case you must manœuvre to
gain time. I should not hesitate to give you a positive order to defer
fighting, if I were certain that Count D’Erlon and his 15,000 men,
and a division from the Army of Aragon, were on their way to you: for
on their arrival the English army would be seriously compromised. But
being wholly uncertain about them, I must repeat to you that if General
Hill is still on the south side of the Tagus, you should choose a good
position and give battle with all your troops united: but if General
Hill joins Lord Wellington, you must avoid an action as long as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p. 396]</span> possible, in order to
pick up the reinforcements which will certainly reach you in the end<a
id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>.’</p>

<p>I think that there can be no doubt in the mind of any honest
critic that on the strength of these two dispatches from his
Commander-in-Chief, Marmont was justified in taking the offensive
against Wellington, without waiting for that help from Madrid which
the King had not offered him. Hill being far away, and Wellington
having no more than his own seven divisions of Anglo-Portuguese,
Marmont is decidedly authorized to bring him to action. The sole factor
which the second Madrid dispatch states wrongly, is the proportion
of British troops in the allied army: Jourdan guesses that there are
50,000 men, but only 18,000 British. As a matter of fact there were
49,000 men at the moment<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474"
class="fnanchor">[474]</a>, but about 30,000 were British. This made a
difference, no doubt, and Marmont, if he had been determined to avoid
a battle, might have pleaded it as his justification. But he was not
set on any such timid policy: he had wellnigh attacked Wellington
at San Cristobal on June 21st, when he had not yet received his own
reinforcements. When Bonnet had come up, and the British had obtained
no corresponding addition to their strength, he was eager to take the
offensive, and Joseph’s and Jourdan’s dispatches distinctly authorized
him to do so.</p>

<p>After the disaster of Salamanca, Napoleon drew up an indictment of
Marmont, of which the three chief heads were:</p>

<p>(1) He took the offensive without waiting for reinforcements which
were to join him.</p>

<p>(2) He delivered battle without the authorization of his
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>(3) He might, by waiting only two days longer, before he committed
himself to a general action, have received at least the cavalry and
guns which he knew that Caffarelli had sent him<a id="FNanchor_475"
href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>.</p>

<p>The very complete answer to these charges is that:</p>

<p>(1) When the Marshal took the offensive he had no reason<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[p. 397]</span> to suppose that any
reinforcements were coming. Caffarelli had excused himself: the King
had promised succour only if Hill joined Wellington, not otherwise.
Hill had never appeared: therefore no help was likely to come from the
southward.</p>

<p>(2) He had clear permission from Joseph to give battle, unless Hill
should have joined Wellington.</p>

<p>(3) The succours from Caffarelli, a weak cavalry brigade and one
battery, were so small that their arrival would have made no practical
difference to the strength of the army. But to have waited two days for
them, after the campaign had commenced, would have given Wellington
the opportunity of concentrating, and taking up a good position. It
was only after the manœuvring had begun [July 15th] that this little
brigade started from Vittoria, on July 16th. The Army of Portugal had
already committed itself to offensive operations, and could not halt
for two days in the midst of them, without losing the initiative.</p>

<p>From his own point of view, then, Marmont was entirely justified in
recrossing the Douro and assuming the offensive. He had got all the
reinforcements that he could count upon: they made his army practically
equal to Wellington’s in numbers: in homogeneity it was far superior.
If he had waited a little longer, he might have found 12,000 men of the
Army of Galicia at his back, setting all Old Castile and Leon aflame.
Moreover Astorga was only victualled up to August 1st, and might fall
any day. He could not have foreseen King Joseph’s unexpected march to
his aid, which no dispatch received before July 12th rendered likely.
His misfortune (or fault) was that he undervalued the capacity of
Wellington to manœuvre, his readiness to force on an offensive battle,
and (most of all) the fighting value of the Anglo-Portuguese army.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Marmont’s method of taking the offensive
against Wellington was neat and effective. It consisted in a feint
against his adversary’s left wing, followed by a sudden countermarch
and a real attack upon his right wing.</p>

<p>On July 15th Foy and Bonnet, with the two divisions forming the
French right, received orders to restore the bridge of Toro, to
drive in Wellington’s cavalry screen in front of it, and to cross to
the south bank of the Douro. At the same time<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span> the divisions of the French centre,
opposite the fords of Pollos, made an ostentatious move down-stream
towards Toro, accompanied by the Marshal himself, and those on the
left, near Tordesillas, shifted themselves towards Pollos. Almost the
whole French army was clearly seen marching westward, and the two
leading divisions were actually across the river next morning, and
seemed to be heading straight for Salamanca by the Toro road.</p>

<p>Wellington was deceived, exactly as Marmont had intended. He drew
the obvious conclusion that his adversary was about to turn his left
flank, and to strike at Salamanca and his line of communications. It
would have been in his power to make a corresponding move against
Valladolid, Marmont’s base. But his own line of communications meant
much more to him than did Marmont’s. There was a great difference
between the position of an army living by transport and magazines, and
that of an army living on the country by plunder, like that of the
French marshal. Wellington had always been jealous of his left wing,
and as early as July 12 had drawn up an elaborate order of march,
providing for the contingency of the enemy crossing the Douro at Toro
and the ford of Castro Nuño. If his entire force seemed on the move,
the whole British army would make a corresponding shift westward—if
only a division or two, the mass transferred would be less in similar
proportion. He had no idea of defending the actual course of the
river: in a letter written a few days later to Lord Bathurst, he
remarked that ‘it was totally out of my power to prevent the enemy from
crossing the Douro at any point at which he might think it expedient,
as he had in his possession all the bridges [Toro and Tordesillas]
and many of the fords<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476"
class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.’ His plan was to concentrate against the
crossing force, and fight a defensive action against it, wherever a
good position might be available.</p>

<p>There were two reasons for which Wellington regarded a genuine
offensive move of Marmont by Toro and Castro Nuño as probable. The
first was that he had received King Joseph’s dispatch of July 9th,
captured by guerrilleros, which gave him the startling news that the
King had resolved to evacuate all New Castile save Madrid and Toledo,
and to march with his field-force of some 14,000 men to join the
Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span> of Portugal<a
id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>.
Wellington wrote to Graham (who was now on his way home) early on the
16th, that either the Galicians’ approach on his rear had induced
Marmont to collect his troops near Toro, or he had heard that Joseph
was gathering the Army of the Centre at Madrid, and was threatening
the allied left ‘in order to prevent us from molesting the King.’ It
was clear that if Wellington had to shift westward to protect his
line of communications, he could make no detachment to ‘contain’
King Joseph, who would be approaching from the south-east. Another
letter, written an hour or so later, says, ‘these movements of
Marmont are certainly intended to divert our attention from the Army
of the Centre (which is collecting at Madrid), if he knows of this
circumstance, <i>which I doubt</i><a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478"
class="fnanchor">[478]</a>.’ The doubt was well grounded.</p>

<p>That the whole movement on Toro was a feint did not occur to
Wellington, but his orders of the 16th, given in the evening, after he
had heard that two French divisions were actually across the Douro on
his left, provide for the possibility that some serious force may still
remain at Tordesillas and may require observation.</p>

<p>The orders direct the transference of the great bulk of the allied
army to a position which will cover the road Toro-Salamanca. They were
issued in the evening to the following effect. The reserve (1st and
7th Divisions) was to march from Medina del Campo to Alaejos beyond
the Trabancos river, and subsequently to Canizal and Fuente la Peña
behind the Guarena river. The left wing, which was watching the fords
of Pollos (3rd Division, Bock’s cavalry, Bradford’s and Carlos de
España’s infantry), to Castrillo on the Guarena. Of the right wing
the 6th Division and two regiments of Le Marchant’s horse were to
move on Fuente la Peña, the 5th Division on Canizal. Alten’s cavalry
brigade was to follow the 1st Division. This left the 4th and Light
Divisions and Anson’s cavalry still unaccounted for. They were set
aside to act as a sort of rearguard, being directed to move westward
only as far as Castrejon on the Trabancos river, ten miles short of
the concentration-point on the Toro road, to which the rest of the
army was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span> ordered
to proceed. It is clear (though Wellington does not say so) that they
would serve as a containing force, if the enemy had left any troops at
Tordesillas, and brought them over the Douro there, or at the fords of
Pollos.</p>

<p>All these moves were duly executed, and on the morning of the 17th
Wellington’s army was getting into position to withstand the expected
advance of the enemy on Salamanca by the Toro road. This attack,
however, failed to make itself felt, and presently news came that the
two divisions of Foy and Bonnet, which had crossed the Douro at Toro,
had gone behind it again, and destroyed their bridge. What Marmont had
done during the night of the 16th-17th was to reverse the marching
order of his whole army, the rear suddenly becoming the head, and the
head the rear. The divisions to the eastward, which had not yet got
near Toro, countermarched on Tordesillas, and crossed its bridge,
with the light cavalry at their head. Those which had reached Toro
brought up the rear, and followed, with Foy and Bonnet, at the tail
of the column. This was a most fatiguing march for all concerned, the
distance from Toro to Tordesillas being about twenty miles, and the
operation being carried out in the night hours. But it was completely
successful—during the morning of the 17th the vanguard, consisting of
Clausel’s and Maucune’s divisions and Curto’s <i>chasseurs à cheval</i>,
was pouring over the bridge of Tordesillas and occupying Rueda and La
Seca, which the British had evacuated fifteen hours before. The rest
followed, the two rear divisions cutting a corner, and saving a few
miles, by crossing the ford of Pollos. This was a safe move, when the
cavalry had discovered that there were none of Wellington’s troops
left east of the Trabancos river. By night on the 17th the bulk of the
French army was concentrated at Nava del Rey, ten miles south-west
of Tordesillas. In the afternoon Wellington’s rearguard, the 4th and
Light Divisions, and Anson’s cavalry had been discovered in position at
Castrejon, where their commander had halted them, when he discovered
that he had been deceived as to his adversary’s purpose. The rest of
the British army had concentrated, according to orders, in the triangle
Canizal-Castrillo-Fuente la Peña, behind the Guarena river and in front
of the Toro-Salamanca road.</p>

    THE SALAMANCA CAMPAIGN
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p.
401]</span>Wellington’s first task was to drawback his rearguard to
join his main body, without allowing it to become seriously engaged
with the great mass of French in its front. This he undertook in
person, marching at daylight with all his disposable cavalry, the
brigades of Bock and Le Marchant, to join the force at Castrejon,
while he threw out the 5th Division to Torrecilla de la Orden to act
as a supporting échelon on the flank of the retiring detachment. The
remaining divisions (1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th) took up a position in line
of battle on the heights above the Guarena, ready to receive their
comrades when they should appear.</p>

<p>The charge of the rearguard this day was in the hands of Stapleton
Cotton, the senior cavalry officer with the army, who outranked Cole
and Charles Alten, the commanders of the 4th and Light Divisions.
He had received no orders during the night, and his last, those of
the preceding afternoon, had directed him to halt, till his chief
should have discovered the true position and aim of the French army.
Wellington explained, in his next dispatch home, that the various
details of intelligence, which enabled him to grasp Marmont’s whole
plan, did not reach him till so late on the 17th that it was useless
to send Cotton orders to start. They could only be carried out at
dawn, and he himself intended to be present with the rearguard before
the sun was far above the horizon. He arrived at seven o’clock in the
morning, in time to find his lieutenant already engaged with the French
van, but not committed to any dangerous close fighting. Cotton had,
very wisely, sent out patrols before daylight to discover exactly what
was in front of him; if it was only a trifling body he intended to
drive it in, and advance towards La Nava and Rueda<a id="FNanchor_479"
href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>; if Marmont was in
force he would take up a defensive position at Castrejon, and wait for
further orders.</p>

<p>The patrols soon ran into French cavalry advancing in force,
and were driven back upon Anson’s brigade, which was drawn up on a
long front in advance of the village of Castrejon. On seeing it,
the enemy brought up two batteries of horse<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> artillery, and began to play upon the
scattered squadrons. Bull’s and Ross’s troops<a id="FNanchor_480"
href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> were ordered out to
reply, and did so with effect, but the total strength of the French
cavalry was too great, and Anson’s regiments had presently to give way,
though not so much owing to the pressure on their front as to the sight
of a large column of French infantry turning the left of their line,
and marching on Alaejos, with the obvious intention of getting round to
their left rear and molesting their retreat towards the Guarena, where
the main body of the British army was awaiting them.</p>

<p>Wellington was involved in person in the end of the cavalry
bickering, and in no very pleasant fashion. He and Beresford, with
their staffs, had arrived on the field about seven o’clock, in advance
of the two heavy cavalry brigades, who were coming up to reinforce
Cotton. He rode forward to the left of the skirmishing line, where two
squadrons, one of the 11th and one of the 12th Light Dragoons, were
supporting two guns of Ross’s troop, on high ground above the ravine
of the Trabancos river. Just as the Commander-in-Chief came on the
scene, a squadron of French cavalry, striking in from the flank, rode
at the guns, not apparently seeing the supporting troops. They met
and broke the squadron of the 12th Light Dragoons, which came up the
hill to intercept them. ‘Some of Marshal Beresford’s staff, seeing
this, and conceiving the guns to be in danger, rode up to the retiring
squadron calling “Threes about<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481"
class="fnanchor">[481]</a>!”’ This unfortunately was heard by the
supporting squadron of the 11th, who, imagining the order to be
directed to themselves, went about and retired, instead of advancing
to relieve their broken comrades above. Therefore the mass of pursuers
and pursued from the combat on the flank, came hurtling down on the
guns, and on the head-quarters staff just behind them. Wellington
and Beresford and their followers were swept away in the rout, and
had to draw their swords to defend themselves. Fortunately the
misdirected squadron of the 11th soon saw their mistake; they halted
and turned, and falling on the scattered and exhausted French dragoons
drove them back with great loss; few, it is said, except their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span> <i>chef d’escadron</i>,
who showed uncommon gallantry, got away<a id="FNanchor_482"
href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. It was a dangerous
moment for the allied army—a chance thrust in the <i>mêlée</i> might have
killed or disabled Wellington, and have thrown the command into the
hands of Beresford or Stapleton Cotton.</p>

<p>Wellington had no sooner detected the flank movement of Marmont’s
infantry towards Alaejos, than he ordered the 4th and Light Divisions
to retire towards the Guarena, covered by G. Anson’s brigade, while
Bock’s and Le Marchant’s heavy dragoons, farther to the left, drew
up in front of the infantry of the turning column, and detained it,
retiring, when pressed, by alternate brigades. Marmont’s whole army was
now visible, moving on in two long columns, of which the more southern
followed the 4th and Light Divisions, in the direction of Torrecilla
de la Orden, and tried to come up with their rear, while the other,
passing through Alaejos, made by the high-road for Castrillo on the
Guarena, where the British reserves were posted.</p>

<p>There was a long bickering fight across the eight miles of rolling
ground between the Trabancos and the Guarena, not without some exciting
moments for Wellington’s rearguard. After passing Torrecilla de la
Orden, and picking up there the 5th Division, which had been waiting
as a supporting échelon to cover their southern flank, all the British
infantry had to march very hard, for troops diverging from the northern
French column got close in upon their right, and, moving parallel
with them, bid fair to reach the Guarena first. In the retreat the
4th Division moved on the right, and was therefore most exposed, the
Light Division next them, the 5th Division farther south and more
distant from the turning column of the French. The cavalry pursuit in
the rear of the retreating force was never really dangerous: it was
held off by Le Marchant’s Heavy and Anson’s Light Dragoons without any
great difficulty, and the 5th and Light Divisions only suffered from
some distant shelling by the French horse artillery. But the 4th<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[p. 404]</span> Division, though covered
from the pursuit in their direct rear by Bock’s German squadrons, found
a dangerous point about a mile on the near side of the Guarena, where
two batteries from the French turning column had galloped forward to a
knoll, commanding the ground over which they had to pass, and opened
a teasing fire upon the flank of the brigades as they marched by.
General Cole, however, threw out his divisional battery and all his
light companies to form a screen against their attack, and moved on,
protected by their fire, without turning from his route. The covering
force fell in to the rear when the defiling was over, and the division
suffered small loss from its uncomfortable march<a id="FNanchor_483"
href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

<p>Wellington allowed all the three retreating divisions to halt
for a moment on the farther side of the stream, at the bottom of
the trough in which it runs. ‘The halt near the water, short as it
was, gave refreshment and rest to the troops, after a rapid march
over an arid country in extremely hot weather<a id="FNanchor_484"
href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.’ But it could not be
allowed to last for more than a very few minutes, for the pursuing
enemy soon appeared in force at several points on the heights above the
eastern bank of the Guarena, and many batteries opened successively
on the three divisions, who were of necessity compelled to resume
their march up the slope to the crest, on their own side of the
water. Here they fell into position on Wellington’s chosen defensive
fighting-ground, the 4th Division forming the extreme northern section
of the battle array, by the village of Castrillo, the Light and 5th
Divisions falling in to the line of troops already drawn up in front of
Canizal, while the 1st and 7th Divisions were extended to the south,
to form the new right wing, and took their place on the heights of
Vallesa, above the village and ford of El Olmo.</p>

<p>Some anxious hours had been spent while the retreat was in
progress, but Wellington was now safe, with every man concen<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span>trated on an excellent
position, where he was prepared to accept the defensive battle for
which he had been waiting for the last month. It seemed likely at first
that his wish might be granted, for the French made a vigorous attack
upon his left wing, almost before it had got settled down into its
appointed ground. It would appear that General Clausel, who commanded
the more northerly of the two great columns in which the French army
was advancing (while Marmont himself was with the other), thought that
he saw his chance of carrying the heights above Castrillo and turning
the allied left, if he attacked at once, before the 4th Division had
been granted time to array itself at leisure. Accordingly, without
wasting time by sending to ask permission from his chief, he directed
a brigade of dragoons to outflank Cole’s left by crossing the Guarena
down-stream, while Brennier’s division passed it at Castrillo and
assailed the front of the 4th Division. Clausel’s own division advanced
in support of Brennier’s.</p>

<p>This move brought on very sharp fighting: the turning movement
of the French dragoons was promptly met by Victor Alten’s brigade
[14th Light Dragoons, 1st Hussars K.G.L.], whose squadrons had been
watching the lower fords of the Guarena all day. Alten allowed the
hostile cavalry to cross the river and come up the slope, and then
charged suddenly, in échelon of squadrons, the left squadron of the
1st Hussars K.G.L. leading<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485"
class="fnanchor">[485]</a>. The enemy had only begun to deploy when
he was attacked, Alten’s advance having been too rapid for him. The
two French regiments (15th and 25th Dragoons) were, after a stiff
fight, completely routed and driven downhill with great loss, till
they finally found refuge behind a half-battery and an infantry
battalion which formed their supports. General Carrié, commanding the
two regiments, was taken prisoner by a German hussar, having got cut
off from his men in the flight. The French lost in all 8 officers
and more than 150 men, of whom 94 were prisoners—mostly wounded. How
sharp the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span> clash
was may be seen from the fact that Alten’s victorious brigade had
not much fewer casualties—the 14th Light Dragoons lost 75 killed and
wounded, the German hussars 60<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486"
class="fnanchor">[486]</a>. But no doubt some of these losses were
suffered not in the cavalry combat, but a little later in the
day, when Alten charged the French infantry<a id="FNanchor_487"
href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>.</p>

<p>While this lively fight was in progress on the flank, Brennier’s
division had crossed the Guarena in a mass, and on a very short
front, apparently in three columns of regiments, battalion behind
battalion. They were ascending the lower slopes below Cole’s position,
when Wellington, who was present here in person, suddenly took the
offensive against them, sending W. Anson’s brigade (3/27th and
1/40th) against them in line, with Stubbs’s Portuguese (11th and 23rd
regiments) supporting, in columns of quarter distance. The French
division halted, apparently with the intention of deploying—but there
was no time for this. The line of Anson’s brigade enveloped both the
hostile flanks with its superior frontage, and opened fire: after a
short resistance the French gave way in great disorder, and streamed
down to the Guarena. As they fled Alten let loose part of his brigade
against their flank: the horsemen rode in deep among the fugitives,
and cut off 6 officers and 240 men as prisoners. Clausel had to bring
up a regiment of his own division to cover the broken troops as they
repassed the river; it suffered severely from Cole’s artillery, losing
6 officers killed and wounded, and many men<a id="FNanchor_488"
href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>.</p>

<p>The attempt to take liberties with Wellington’s army, when it had
assumed the defensive on favourable ground, had thus failed in the
most lamentable style, and with very heavy loss—at least 700 men
had been killed, wounded, or taken in Marmont’s army that day, and
all but a few scores belonged to the four infantry and two cavalry
regiments which Clausel sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[p.
407]</span> attack the heights by Castrillo<a id="FNanchor_489"
href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. The corresponding
British loss that day was 525, including about 50 stragglers taken
prisoners during the retreat from the Trabancos to the Guarena, because
they had fallen behind their regiments—foot-sore infantry, or troopers
whose horses had been shot. The cavalry, which had so successfully
covered the long march across the open, had a certain amount of
casualties, but the only units that had suffered heavily were the four
regiments—horse and foot—that dealt with Clausel’s attack, who lost 276
men between them.</p>

<p>Wellington must have felt much disappointment at seeing Clausel’s
offensive move at Castrillo unsupported by the rest of the French
divisions, who were lining the farther bank of the Guarena parallel
with the whole of his front. But Marmont, unlike his venturesome
subordinate, nourished no illusions about the advisability of attacking
a British army in position. He made no move in the afternoon; in his
memoirs he points out that the infantry was absolutely exhausted,
having been continuously on the march for three days and one night.</p>

<p>This day had been a disappointing one for the French marshal
also. He had failed to cut off Wellington’s two detached divisions,
so that all the advantage which he had obtained by his marches and
countermarches between Toro and Tordesillas was now exhausted. The
allied army had succeeded in concentrating, and was now drawn up in
his front, covering Salamanca and its own line of communications in a
very tenable position. Napier truly remarks that, since the attempt to
isolate and destroy Cotton’s detachment had miscarried, Marmont had
gained no more by his elaborate feint and forced marches than he would
have obtained by continuing his original advance across Toro bridge
on the 16th. He had got the whole Anglo-Portuguese army arrayed in a
defensive position in front of him, on the line of the Guarena, instead
of somewhere in the neighbourhood of Fuente Sauco, a few miles farther
east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[p. 408]</span>On the morning
of the 19th July it seemed as if a new deadlock was to bring the
campaign to a standstill, for the two armies continued to face each
other across the Guarena, Wellington hoping rather than expecting to be
attacked, Marmont looking in vain for a weak point between Castrillo
and Vallesa, where it would be worth while to try a forward thrust.
While he was reconnoitring, his weary infantry got a much-needed rest.
At about four o’clock in the afternoon, however, the whole French
army was seen falling into column, and presently edged off southward
till it lay between Tarazona and Cantalapiedra. Wellington thereupon
made a corresponding movement, evacuating Castrillo to the north, and
extending his line of battle beyond Vallesa to the south. There was a
little distant cannonading across the valley of the Guarena, and some
of the shells set fire to the vast fields of ripe wheat which covered
the whole country-side in this region. The conflagration went rolling
on for a long way across the plain, leaving a trail of smoke behind.</p>

<p>The situation on this evening had nothing decisive about it. It
was clear that neither side intended to fight save at an advantage.
Marmont had shown himself more cautious than had been expected.
Wellington had at this moment every motive for risking nothing, unless
the enemy proved more obliging than he had shown himself hitherto. He
had reasons for self-restraint at this moment of which his adversary
knew nothing. The first was that he was aware (from intercepted
dispatches) of King Joseph’s intention to march from Madrid to join
the Army of Portugal: with a possible 15,000 men about to appear on
his flank, he must look to the future with care. The second was that
he had received a few days before the untoward news that Lord William
Bentinck’s long-promised expedition to Catalonia might not ever take
place. The Commander-in-Chief in Sicily wrote that he had found new
opportunities in Italy, which it might be his duty to seize. His troops
had been embarked, but they were not to be expected for the present off
the coast of Spain. This was a disheartening piece of intelligence:
Wellington had been told to count upon this support both by Bentinck
himself and by the Home Government. If it should fail, Marshal Suchet,
left undisturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span>
by this diversion, might send considerable reinforcements to Madrid<a
id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he did not—being, like Soult, a general of much
too self-centred a type of mind to help a neighbour if he could avoid
it. Only one regiment of the Valencian army ever got to Madrid, and
that came too late for King Joseph’s purpose. But so far as Wellington
could guess on July 19, it was quite possible that Suchet might
find 10,000 men, to add to the disposable 15,000 of the Army of the
Centre.</p>

<p>There was also the possibility that D’Erlon, obeying the orders
which King Joseph kept sending to him, might make up his mind to cross
the Guadiana and Tagus, and come north by Arzobispo and Madrid. If so,
Hill was to make a parallel march by Alcantara, and would certainly
arrive many days before D’Erlon. This was a mere possibility; there
were good reasons for holding that Soult might forbid any such move;
and till D’Erlon started northward, Hill must remain behind to contain
him. The problem was not pressing: it could not develop for many days<a
id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand there was news that the Galicians were at last on
the move. Santocildes had been prevailed upon to leave a smaller force
to besiege Astorga, and had come down with a second division to join
Cabrera at Benavente. This force, advancing up the Douro valley, would
find absolutely no enemy in front of it, and must obviously disturb
Marmont’s operations, since it might be at the gates of Valladolid,
his base and storehouse, in a few days. He would then be forced to
detach a division or so to save his dépôts, and he could not spare
even a brigade if he wished to continue on the offensive. Certain
intelligence that there was not a Frenchman left behind on the Douro,
save the trifling garrisons of Toro, Zamora, and Tordesillas, had been
brought in by General D’Urban. That officer, after conducting a very
daring exploration round the rear of Marmont’s army, almost to the
gates of Valladolid, had recrossed the Douro by Wellington’s orders
at the ford of Fresno de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p.
410]</span> Ribera, and fell in upon the left flank of the allied army
near Fuente Sauco on July 18th<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492"
class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. For the rest of the campaign his 700 sabres
were at Wellington’s disposal<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493"
class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. His report showed that Marmont’s rear
was absolutely undefended, and that the Galicians could march up the
Douro, if desired, without finding any opponents: it would be perfectly
possible for them to cut all Marmont’s communications with Valladolid
and Burgos, without being in any danger unless the Marshal detached men
against them.</p>

<p>The 20th of July proved to be a most interesting day of manœuvring,
but still brought no decisive results. Early in the morning the whole
French army was seen in march, with its head pointing southward,
continuing the movement that it had begun on the previous day. Marmont
had made up his mind to proceed with the hitherto unsuccessful
scheme for turning his adversary’s right wing<a id="FNanchor_494"
href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>, in the hope of either
cutting him off from his communication with Salamanca, or of catching
him with his army strung out on too long a line from continuous and
rapid movement. The character of this day’s march differed from that
of the 19th, because the single well-marked Guarena valley ceased
after a time to separate the two hostile armies. That little river is
formed by three tributaries which meet at and above the village of
El Olmo: each of them is a paltry brook, and their courses lie along
trifling irregularities of the broad tableland from which they descend.
It is only after their junction that they flow in a deep well-marked
valley, and form a real military obstacle. Of the three brooks, that
which keeps the name of Guarena lies most to the east: up its right
bank and towards its source Marmont’s march was directed. Wellington’s
parallel movement southward, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span> was directed along the left bank of the
Poreda, the middle brook of the three. Between them there was at first
a narrow triangular plateau, on which neither party trespassed save
with cavalry scouts.</p>

<p>After a few miles of marching Marmont ordered his advanced guard
to cross the Guarena, which they could do with ease, no British being
near, save a few cavalry vedettes. He then turned the head of his
column south-westward, instead of keeping to his original direction
due south. Having crossed the Guarena he came in sight of the British
column marching on the other side of the Poreda brook from Vallesa.
The movements of the two armies tended to converge, the point on
which both were moving being the village of Cantalpino. It seemed
likely that the heads of the marching columns must collide, and that a
combat, if not a general action, would ensue. Each army was marching
in an order that could be converted into a battle line by simply
facing the men to right or to left respectively. Wellington had his
troops in three parallel columns, the first one, that nearest to the
French, being composed of the 1st, 4th, 5th, and Light Divisions, the
second, which would have formed the supporting line if the army had
fronted and gone into action, contained the 6th and 7th and Pack’s
and Bradford’s brigades: the 3rd Division and España’s Spaniards
formed a reserve, moving farthest from the enemy. The light cavalry
were marching ahead of the column, the heavy cavalry and D’Urban’s
Portuguese brought up their rear. Marmont was clearly seen to be moving
in a similar formation, of two columns each composed of four infantry
divisions, with Curto’s <i>chasseurs</i> ahead, and Boyer’s dragoons at the
tail of the line of march<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495"
class="fnanchor">[495]</a>.</p>

<p>The day was warm but clouded, so that the sun did not shine with
full July strength, or the long march which both armies carried out
would have been brought to an end by exhaustion at a much earlier
hour than was actually the case. As the long morning wore on, the two
hostile forces gradually grew closer to each other, owing to the new
westward turn which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[p. 412]</span>
Marmont had given to his van. At last they were within long artillery
range; but for some time no shot was fired, neither party being willing
to take the responsibility of attacking an enemy in perfect order and
well closed up for battle. Either general could have brought on a
fight, by simply fronting to flank, in ten minutes; but neither did so.
Marmont remarks in his <i>Mémoires</i> that in his long military service
he never, before or after, saw such a magnificent spectacle as this
parallel march of two bodies of over 40,000 men each, at such close
quarters. Both sides kept the most admirable order, no gaps occurred in
either line, nor was the country one that offered advantage to either:
it was very nearly flat, and the depression of the Poreda brook became
at last so slight and invisible that it was crossed without being
noticed. The ground, however, on which the French were moving was a
little higher than that on which the allies marched<a id="FNanchor_496"
href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>.</p>

<p>The converging lines of advance at last almost touched each other at
the village of Cantalpino: the light cavalry and the 1st Division, at
the head of Wellington’s front (or eastern) column of march had just
passed through it, when Marmont halted several batteries on a roll of
the ground a few hundred yards off, and began to shell the leading
battalions of the 4th Division, which was following closely behind the
1st. Wellington ordered Cole not to halt and reply, nor to attack, but
to avoid the village and the French fire by a slight westerly turn,
to which the other divisions conformed, both those in the first and
those in the second line<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497"
class="fnanchor">[497]</a>. This amounted to the refusing of battle,
and many officers wondered that the challenge of Marmont had been
refused: for the army was in perfect order for fighting, and in
excellent spirits. But Wellington was taking no risks that day.</p>

<p>The slight swerve from the direct southerly direction at Cantalpino
made by the allied army, distinctly helped Marmont’s plan for
turning its right, since by drawing back from its original line of
movement it allowed the enemy to push still<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span> farther westward than his original line
of march had indicated. This meant that he was gradually getting
south of Wellington’s vanguard, and would, if not checked, ultimately
arrive at the Tormes river, near the fords of Huerta, from which he
would have been edged off, if both armies had continued in their
original direction. During the early afternoon the parallel move
continued, with a little skirmishing between cavalry vedettes, and an
occasional outbreak of artillery fire, but no further developments.
The baggage in the English rear began to trail behind somewhat,
owing to the long continuance of the forced marching, and D’Urban’s
Portuguese, who shepherded the stragglers, had great difficulty in
keeping them on the move. A few score sick and foot-sore men, and
some exhausted sumpter-beasts, fell behind altogether, and were
abandoned to the French<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498"
class="fnanchor">[498]</a>.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the armies fell further apart, and all save
the outlying vedettes lost sight of each other. This was due to the
fact that Wellington had made up his mind to settle down for the night
on the heights of Cabeza Vellosa and Aldea Rubia, where Marmont had
taken up his position a month before, when he retired from before San
Cristobal. This was good fighting-ground, on which it was improbable
that the French would dare to deliver an attack. The 6th Division and
Alten’s cavalry brigade were detached to the rear, and occupied Aldea
Lengua and its fords.</p>

<p>This had been a most fatiguing day—the British army had marched,
practically in battle formation, not less than four Spanish leagues,
the French, by an extraordinary effort, more than five. When the
camp-fires were lighted up at night, it was seen that the leading
divisions of the enemy were as far south as Babila Fuente, quite
close to the Tormes and the fords of Huerta: the main body lay about
Villaruela, opposite the British bivouacs at Aldea Rubia and Cabeza
Vellosa. An untoward incident terminated an unsatisfactory day:
D’Urban’s Portuguese horse coming in very late from their duty of
covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span> the
baggage-train, were mistaken for prowling French cavalry by the 3rd
Division, and shelled by its battery, with some little loss of men
and horses. The mistake was caused by a certain similarity in their
uniform to that of French dragoons—the tall helmets with crests being
worn by no other allied troops<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499"
class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>The net result of the long parallel march of July 20th was that
Marmont had practically turned Wellington’s extreme right, and was
in a position to cross the Upper Tormes, if he should choose, in
prolongation of his previous movement. The allied army was still
covering Salamanca, and could do so for one day more, if the marching
continued: but after that limit of time it would be forced either to
fight or to abandon Salamanca, the main trophy of its earlier campaign.
There remained the chance of falling upon Marmont’s rear, when his army
should be occupied in crossing the Tormes, and forcing him to fight
with his forces divided by the river. If this offensive move were not
taken, and the parallel march were allowed to continue, the next day
would see the armies both across the Tormes, in the position where
Graham and Marmont had demonstrated against each other on June 24th.
Wellington could not, however, begin his southward move till he was
certain that the enemy was about to continue his manœuvre on the same
plan as that of the last two days. If he started too early, Marmont
might attack the San Cristobal position when it was only held by a
rearguard, and capture Salamanca. Till an appreciable fraction of the
French were seen passing the Tormes it was necessary to wait.</p>

<p>It appeared to Wellington that his adversary’s most probable
move would be the passage of the Tormes by the fords at and just
above Huerta. That he would abandon his previous tactics, and attack
the British army, was inconsistent with the caution that he had
hitherto displayed. That he would continue his march southward, and
cross the river higher up, was unlikely; for the obvious passage
in this direction, by the bridge of Alba<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span> de Tormes, was commanded by the castle
of that town, which had been for some time occupied by a battalion
detached from Carlos de España’s division. Wellington looked upon
this route as completely barred to the French: he was unaware that
the Spanish general had withdrawn his detachment without orders on
the preceding afternoon. This astonishing move of his subordinate was
made all the worse by the fact that he never informed his chief that
he had taken upon himself to remove the battalion. Indeed Wellington
only heard of its disappearance on the 23rd, when it was too late to
remedy the fault. He acted on the 21st and 22nd as if Alba de Tormes
were securely held. It would appear that Carlos de España thought the
castle too weak to be held by a small force, and moved his men, in
order to secure them from being cut off from the main army, as they
clearly might be when the French had reached Babila Fuente. But the
importance of his misplaced act was not to emerge till after the battle
of Salamanca had been fought.</p>

<p>At dawn on the 21st Wellington withdrew his whole army on to the
San Cristobal position<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500"
class="fnanchor">[500]</a>, and waited for further developments,
having the fords of Aldea Lengua and Santa Marta conveniently close if
Marmont should be seen crossing the Tormes. This indeed was the move
to which the Marshal committed himself. Having discovered at an early
hour that Alba de Tormes was empty, and that there was no allied force
observing the river bank below it, he began to cross in two columns,
one at the fords of Huerta, the other three miles higher up-stream at
the ford of La Encina. Lest Wellington should sally out upon his rear,
when the greater part of his army had got beyond the Tormes, he left a
covering force of two divisions in position between Babila Fuente and
Huerta. This, as the day wore on, he finally reduced to one division<a
id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> and
some artillery. As long as this detachment remained opposite him,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span> Wellington could not
be sure that the French might not attack him on both sides of the
Tormes.</p>

<p>The defile of the French army across the fords naturally took a long
time, and Wellington was able to allow his weary infantry some hours
of much-needed rest in the morning. Only cavalry was sent forward at
once, to form a screen in front of the hostile force that was gradually
accumulating on the near side of the fords. In the afternoon, however,
when the greater part of the French were over the water, nearly the
whole allied army received orders to cross the Tormes, and occupy the
heights to the south of it. It moved practically in battle order,
in two lines, of which the front passed by the ford of Cabrerizos,
the second by that of Santa Marta. Only a reserve, now consisting
of the 3rd Division and D’Urban’s Portuguese horse, remained on the
north side of the river near Cabrerizos, to contain the French force
which was still visible at dusk on the slopes by Babila Fuente. Till
this detachment had disappeared, Wellington was obliged to leave a
corresponding proportion of his men to contain it, lest the enemy
might try a dash at Salamanca by the north bank. Marmont made no such
attempt, and in the morning it was obvious that this rearguard was
following the rest of his army across the Tormes.</p>

<p>During the night the French advanced cavalry were holding Calvarisa
de Ariba on their left and Machacon on their right: the infantry were
bivouacked in a concentrated position in the wooded country south of
those villages. The British cavalry screen held Calvarisa de Abaxo<a
id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>,
Pelabravo, and the height of Nuestra Señora de la Peña, close in to the
corresponding front line of the enemy’s vedettes. The infantry were
encamped in two lines behind the Ribera de Pelagarcia, the ravine,
which runs north from Nuestra Señora de la Peña to the Tormes, between
Santa Marta and Cabrerizos. This was Graham’s old position of June
24th, and excellent for defence. The right was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span> on well-marked high ground, the centre
was covered by woods. Only the left, near Santa Marta, was on lower
slopes.</p>

<p>About an hour after nightfall the hills where French and English
lay opposite each other were visited by an appalling tempest. ‘The
rain fell in torrents accompanied by vivid flashes of lightning, and
succeeded by instantaneous peals of thunder:’ writes one annalist:
‘a more violent crash of the elements has seldom been witnessed:
its effects were soon apparent. Le Marchands brigade of cavalry had
halted to our left: the men, dismounted, were either seated or lying
on the ground, holding their horses’ bridles. Alarmed by the thunder,
the beasts started with a sudden violence, and many of them breaking
loose galloped across the country in all directions. The frightened
horses, in a state of wildness, passing by without riders, added to the
awful effect of the tempest<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503"
class="fnanchor">[503]</a>.’ The 5th Dragoon Guards suffered most by
the stampede—eighteen men were hurt, and thirty-one horses were not
to be found. Another diarist speaks of the splendid effect of the
lightning reflected on the musket-barrels of belated infantry columns,
which were just marching to their camping-ground. Before midnight
the storm had passed over—the later hours of sleep were undisturbed,
and next morning a brilliant sun rose into a cloudless sky<a
id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. The
last day of manœuvring was begun, and the battle which both sides had
so long avoided was at last to come.</p>

  <p class="subh3">THE BATTLE OF SALAMANCA, JULY 22, 1812.<br />
    THE EARLY STAGES</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> decisive moment of the campaign of
1812 had now been reached—though Marmont was wholly unaware of it, and
was proposing merely to continue his manœuvring of the last five days,
and though Wellington hardly expected that the 22nd of July would turn
out more eventful than the 21st. Both of them have left record of their
intentions on the fateful morning. The Duke of Ragusa wrote to Berthier
as follows: ‘My object was, in taking up this position, to prolong
my movement to the left, in order to dislodge the enemy from the
neighbourhood of Salamanca, and to fight him at a greater advantage. I
calculated on taking up a good defensive position, against which the
enemy could make no offensive move, and intended to press near enough
to him to be able to profit from the first fault that he might make,
and to attack him with vigour<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505"
class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.’ He adds in another document, <span
id="score">‘I considered that our respective positions would bring on
not a battle, but an advantageous rearguard action, in which, using my
full force late in the day, with a part only of the British army left
in front of me, I should probably score a point<a id="FNanchor_506"
href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>.’</span> It is clear
that he reckoned that his adversary would continue his policy of the
last five days; Wellington, if his flank were once more turned, would
move on as before—always parrying the thrusts made at him, but not
taking the offensive himself.</p>

<p>Nor was he altogether wrong in his expectation. Writing to Lord
Bathurst on the evening of July 21st, the British Commander-in-Chief
summed up his intentions in these words. ‘I have determined to cross
the Tormes, if the enemy should: to cover Salamanca as long as I
can: and above all not to give up our communication with Ciudad
Rodrigo: and not to fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p.
419]</span> an action unless under very advantageous circumstances,
or if it should become absolutely necessary<a id="FNanchor_507"
href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>.’ This determination
is re-stated in a dispatch which Wellington wrote three days
later, in a very different frame of mind. ‘I had determined that
if circumstances should not permit me to attack him on the 22nd, I
should move toward Ciudad Rodrigo without further loss of time<a
id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.’
Wellington was therefore, it is clear, intending simply to continue
his retreat without delivering battle, unless Marmont should give him
an opportunity of striking a heavy blow, by putting himself in some
dangerous posture. He desired to fight, but only if he could fight
at advantage. Had Marmont continued to turn his flank by cautious
movements made at a discreet distance, and with an army always ready
to form an orderly line of battle, Wellington would have sacrificed
Salamanca, and moved back toward the Agueda. He was not prepared to
waste men in indecisive combats, which would not put the enemy out of
action even if they went off well. ‘It is better that a battle should
not be fought, unless under such favourable circumstances that there
would be reason to hope that the allied army would be able to maintain
the field, while that of the enemy would not<a id="FNanchor_509"
href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>.’ For if the French
were only checked, and not completely knocked to pieces, Wellington
knew that they would be reinforced within a few days by the 14,000
men whom King Joseph (unknown to Marmont) was bringing up from
Madrid. Retreat would then again become necessary, since the enemy
would be superior in numbers to a hopeless extent. Wellington added
that the 22nd was his best day of advantage, since within thirty-six
hours Marmont would have been reinforced by the cavalry brigade
under General Chauvel, which Caffarelli had at last sent forward
from Burgos. It had reached the Douro at Valladolid on the 20th, and
would be up at the front on the 23rd: this he well knew, and somewhat
overrated its strength<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510"
class="fnanchor">[510]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[p. 420]</span>But though ready
to take his advantage, if it were offered him, Wellington evidently
leaned to the idea that it would not be given. He prepared for retreat,
by sending off his whole baggage-train on the Ciudad Rodrigo road at
dawn, escorted by one of D’Urban’s three Portuguese cavalry regiments.
This was a clear expression of his intention to move off. So is his
letter of July 24 to Graham in which, writing in confidence to a
trusted subordinate, he remarks, ‘Marmont ought to have given me a
<i>pont d’or</i>, and then he would have made a handsome operation of it.’
Instead of furnishing the proverbial bridge of gold to the yielding
adversary, the Marshal pressed in upon him in a threatening fashion,
yet with his troops so scattered and strung out on a long front, that
he was not ready for a decisive action when Wellington at last saw his
opportunity and dashed in upon him.</p>

<p>At dawn on the 22nd each party had to discover the exact position
of his adversary, for the country-side was both wooded and undulating.
Wellington’s army, on the line of heights reaching southward from Santa
Marta, was almost entirely masked, partly by the woods in the centre of
his position, but still more by his having placed all the divisions far
back from the sky-line on the reverse slope of the plateau. The front
was about three miles long, but little was visible upon it. Foy, whose
division was ahead of the rest of the French army, describes what he
saw as follows:—</p>

<p>‘The position of San Cristobal had been almost stripped of troops:
we could see one English division in a sparsely-planted wood within
cannon-shot of Calvarisa de Ariba, on the Salamanca road: very far
behind a thin column was ascending the heights of Tejares: nothing
more could be made out of Wellington’s army: all the rest was hidden
from us by the chain of heights which runs from north to south, and
ends in the high and precipitous knolls of the Arapiles. Wellington
was on this chain, sufficiently near for us to recognize by means of
the staff surrounding him<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511"
class="fnanchor">[511]</a>.’</p>

<p>All, then, that Foy, and Marmont who was riding near him, actually
saw, was the 7th Division in the wood opposite Nuestra Señora de la
Peña, and the distant baggage-column already<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_421">[p. 421]</span> filing off on the Ciudad Rodrigo road,
which ascends the heights beyond Aldea Tejada four miles to the
rear.</p>

<p>The French army was a little more visible to Wellington, who could
not only make out Foy’s division behind Calvarisa de Ariba, but several
other masses farther south and east, in front of the long belt of
woods which extends on each side of the village of Utrera for some
two miles or more. It was impossible to see how far the French left
reached among the dense trees: but the right was ‘refused:’ no troops
were opposite Wellington’s left or northern wing, and the villages of
Pelabravo and Calvarisa de Abaxo, far in advance of it, were still
held by British cavalry vedettes. In short, only the allied right and
centre had enemies in front of them. This indicated what Wellington
had expected—an attempt of Marmont to continue his old policy of
outflanking his adversary’s extreme right: clearly the British left was
not in danger.</p>

<p>Marmont, as his exculpatory dispatch to Berthier acknowledges,
was convinced that Wellington would retire once more the moment that
his flank was threatened. ‘Everything led me to believe,’ he writes,
‘that the enemy intended to occupy the position of Tejares [across
the Zurgain] which lay a league behind him, while at present he
was a league and a half in front of Salamanca<a id="FNanchor_512"
href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>.’ Foy’s diary
completely bears out this view of Marmont’s conception of the
situation. ‘The Marshal had no definite plan: he thought that the
English army was already gone off, or at least that it was going off,
to take position on the heights of Tejares on the left [or farther]
bank of the river Zurgain. He was tempted to make an attack on the one
visible English division, with which a skirmishing fire had already
begun. He was fearing that this division might get out of his reach!
How little did he foresee the hapless lot of his own army that day!
The wily Wellington was ready to give battle—the greater part of his
host was collected, but masked behind the line of heights: he was
showing nothing on the crest, lest his intention should be divined: he
was waiting for our movement<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513"
class="fnanchor">[513]</a>.’</p>

<p>The skirmish to which Foy alludes was one begun by the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[p. 422]</span> <i>voltigeurs</i> of his own
division, whom Marmont had ordered forward, to push back the English
pickets on the height of Nuestra Señora de la Peña. These belonged to
the 7th Division, which was occupying the wood behind. Not wishing his
position to be too closely examined, Wellington sent out two whole
battalions, the 68th and the 2nd Caçadores, who formed a very powerful
screen of light troops, and pushed back the French from the hill and
the ruined chapel on top of it. Marmont then strengthened his firing
line, and brought up a battery, which checked the further advance of
the allied skirmishers. The two screens continued to exchange shots
for several hours, half a mile in front of Wellington’s position. The
<i>tiraillade</i> had many episodes, in one of which General Victor Alten,
leading a squadron of his hussars to protect the flank of the British
skirmishers, received a ball in the knee, which put him out of action,
and threw the command of his brigade into the hands of Arentschildt,
colonel of the 1st Hussars K.G.L. After much bickering, and when noon
had long passed, the 68th and Caçadores were relieved by some companies
of the 95th from the Light Division, as Wellington wished to employ
the 7th Division elsewhere. He had at first thought it possible that
Marmont was about to make a serious attack on this part of his front;
but the notion died away when it was seen that the Marshal did not send
up any formed battalions to support his <i>voltigeurs</i>, and allowed the
light troops of the allies to cling to the western half of the slopes
of Nuestra Señora de la Peña.</p>

<p class="mt1">It was soon evident that the French were—as so often
before during the last six days—about to extend their left wing. The
right or southern flank of Wellington’s line rested on the rocky knoll,
400 feet high, which is known as the ‘Lesser Arapile.’ Six hundred
yards from it, and outside the allied zone of occupation, lay the
‘Greater Arapile,’ which is a few feet higher and much longer than its
fellow. These two curious hills, sometimes called the ‘Hermanitos’
or ‘little brothers,’ are the most striking natural feature in the
country-side. They rise a hundred and fifty feet above the valley which
lies between them, and a hundred feet above the heights on either
side. Their general appearance somewhat recalls that of Dartmoor
‘Tors,’ rough rock breaking out through the soil. But their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[p. 423]</span> shapes differ: the
Greater Arapile shows crags at each end, but has a comparatively
smooth ascent to its centre on its northern front—so smooth that steep
ploughed fields have been laid out upon it, and extend almost to the
crest. The Lesser Arapile is precipitous on its southern front, where
it faces its twin, but is joined at its back (or northern) side by a
gentle slope to the main line of the heights where Wellington’s army
lay. It is in short an integral part of them, though it rises far above
their level. The Greater Arapile, on the other hand, is an isolated
height, not belonging to the system of much lower knolls which lies
to its south. These, three-quarters of a mile away, are covered with
wood, and form part of the long forest which reaches as far as the
neighbourhood of Alba de Tormes.</p>

<p>Wellington had left the Greater Arapile outside his position, partly
because it was completely separated from the other heights that he
held, partly (it is said) because he had surveyed the ground in the
dusk, and had judged the knoll farther from the Lesser Arapile than was
actually the case; they were within easy cannon-shot from each other<a
id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>. At
about eight o’clock, French skirmishers were observed breaking out from
the woods to the south of the Arapile and pushing rapidly toward it.
They were followed by supporting columns in strength—indeed Marmont
had directed the whole of Bonnet’s division to move, under cover of
the trees, to the point where the woods approach nearest to the hill,
and from thence to carry it if possible. Wellington, now judging
that it was uncomfortably near to his right flank, ordered the 7th
Caçadores—from the 4th Division, the unit that lay nearest—to race
hard for the Greater Arapile and try to seize it before the French had
arrived. They made good speed but failed: the enemy was on the crest
first, and repulsed them with some loss. They had to fall back to
behind the Lesser Arapile, which was held by the first British brigade
of their division (W. Anson’s).</p>

<p>Marmont had seized the Greater Arapile, as he tells us, to form
a strong advanced post, behind which he could move his main body
westward, in pursuance of his old design of turning Wellington’s right.
It was to be the ‘pivot on which the flanking movement should be made,’
the ‘<i>point d’appui</i> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[p.
424]</span> right of his army’ when it should reach its new position<a
id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>.
Bonnet’s troops being firmly established on and behind it, he began to
move his divisions to their left. On his original ground, the plateau
of Calvarisa de Ariba, he left Foy’s division in front line—still
bickering with the skirmishing line of the allies—Ferey’s division in
support, and Boyer’s dragoons to cover the flank against any possible
attack from the British cavalry, who were in force on Wellington’s
left, and still had detachments out on the plateau by Pelabravo,
beyond Foy’s extreme right. Having made this provision against any
possible attempt to attack him in the rear while he was executing
his great manœuvre, Marmont marched his five remaining divisions<a
id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>,
under cover of Bonnet’s advanced position, to the edge of the wooded
hills in rear of the Great Arapile, where they remained for some time
in a threatening mass, without further movement.</p>

<p>Wellington, clearly discerning from the summit of the Lesser
Arapile this general shift of the enemy to the left, now made great
alterations in the arrangement of his troops, and adopted what may
be called his second battle-position. The 4th Division, about and
around that height, was placed so as to serve for the allied army
the same purpose that Bonnet was carrying out for the French on the
other Hermanito. Of Cole’s three brigades, that of Anson occupied
the Arapile—the 3/27th on the summit, the 1/40th in support on the
rear slope. Pack’s independent Portuguese brigade was placed beside
Anson. The Fusilier brigade (under Ellis of the 1/23rd) and Stubbs’s
Portuguese, the remaining units of the 4th Division, were formed
up to the right of the hill, extending as far as the village which
takes its name of Arapiles from the two strange knolls. Two guns
of Cole’s divisional battery (that of Sympher<a id="FNanchor_517"
href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>) were hoisted up
with some difficulty to the level of the 3/27th. The other four
were left with the Fusiliers near the village<a id="FNanchor_518"
href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>. Thus the little
Arapile became the obtuse angle of a formation<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span> ‘en potence,’ with Pack and two brigades
of the 4th Division on its right, and the 7th Division (still engaged
at a distance with Foy) and the 1st and Light Divisions on its left.
At the same time Wellington moved down the troops which had originally
formed his left wing (5th and 6th Divisions, España’s Spaniards, and
Bradford’s Portuguese) to a supporting position behind his centre,
somewhere near the village of Las Torres, where they could reinforce
either his right or his left, as might prove necessary in the end.
As a further general reserve G. Anson’s and Le Marchant’s cavalry
brigades, and the greater part of Victor Alten’s, were brought away
from the original left, and placed in reserve near the 6th Division;
but Bock and two of Victor Alten’s squadrons<a id="FNanchor_519"
href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> remained on the left,
opposite Boyer’s dragoons.</p>

<p>In connexion with this same general move, Wellington sent a most
important order to the troops which he had left till this moment on
the north bank of the Tormes, covering Salamanca, in the position by
Cabrerizos. These consisted of the 3rd Division—which was under the
temporary command of Edward Pakenham (Wellington’s brother-in-law)
during Picton’s sickness—and the 500 sabres that remained of
D’Urban’s Portuguese horse, after one regiment had been sent off on
escort-duty with the baggage-train. These corps were directed to march
over the town-bridge of Salamanca, and take up a position between
Aldea Tejada and La Penilla, to the east of the high-road to Ciudad
Rodrigo. There placed, they were available either as a reserve to the
newly-formed right wing, or as a supporting échelon, if the whole
army should ultimately fall back for a retreat along the high-road,
or as a detached force placed so far to the right that it could
outflank or throw itself in front of any French troops which might
continue Marmont’s advance from the Arapiles westward. It is probable
that Wellington, at the moment when he gave the orders, would have
been quite unable to say which of these three duties would fall to
Pakenham’s share. The 3rd Division marched from Cabrerizos at noon,
passing through the city, which was at this moment full of alarms and
excursions. For the sight of Marmont close at hand, and of the British
baggage-train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[p. 426]</span>
moving off hastily toward Rodrigo, had filled the inhabitants with
dismay. Some were hiding their more valuable property, others (who
had compromised themselves by their friendly reception of the allied
army) were preparing for hasty flight. Some used bitter language of
complaint—the English were retreating without a battle after betraying
their friends.</p>

<p>Pakenham and D’Urban reached their appointed station
by two o’clock,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520"
class="fnanchor">[520]</a> and halted in a dip in the ground, well
screened by trees, between La Penilla and Aldea Tejada, where they
could barely be seen from the highest slopes of Wellington’s position,
and not at all from any other point. For some time they were left
undisturbed, listening to a growing noise of artillery fire to their
left front, where matters were evidently coming to a head.</p>

<p>At about eleven o’clock Marmont had climbed to the summit of the
French Arapile, from whence he obtained for the first time a partial
view into the British position; for looking up the dip in the ground
between the Lesser Arapile and the heights occupied by the Fusilier
brigade of the 4th Division, he could catch a glimpse of some of the
movements that were going on at the back of Wellington’s first line.
Apparently he saw the 1st and Light Divisions behind the crest of
their destined fighting position, and the 5th and 6th and Bradford’s
Portuguese taking ground to their right. Pack’s Portuguese on the
flank and rear of the British Arapile must also have been visible at
least in part. The conclusion to which he came was that his adversary
was accumulating forces behind the Lesser Arapile with the object of
sallying out against Bonnet, whose post was very far advanced in front
of the rest of the French army, and against Foy and Ferey, who were
left in a somewhat isolated position on the plateau by Calvarisa, when
the main body of the army had moved so far to the west.</p>

<p>Some such intention seems for a moment to have been in Wellington’s
mind, though he says nothing of it in his dispatch. ‘About twelve
o’clock,’ writes one of the most trustworthy British diarists, ‘the
troops were ordered to attack, and the 1st Division moved forward
to gain the other Arapile, which the French had taken.... There was
something singular, I think, in Lord Wellington’s ordering the 1st and
Light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[p. 427]</span> Divisions
to attack early in the day, and then counter-ordering them after
they had begun to move. Marshal Beresford, no doubt, was the cause
of the alteration, by what he urged. Yet at the same time Lord W.
is so little influenced (or indeed allows any person to say a word)
that his attending to the Marshal was considered singular. From all
I could collect and observe “the Peer” was a little nervous: it was
the first time he had ever attacked. When he <i>did</i> finally determine
on the attack it was well done, in the most decided manner. There
was possibly some little trouble in arriving at that decision<a
id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>.’
Oddly enough this contemporary note is exactly borne out by Marmont’s
statement in his <i>Mémoires</i>, that meeting Wellington years after, he
inquired about the point, and was frankly told that an attack had been
projected at this moment, but that it had been put off in consequence
of the representation of Beresford, who had counselled delay<a
id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>.
There was a heavy mass of troops available behind the Lesser Arapile
and to both sides of it—the 4th Division, Pack’s Portuguese, and the
1st, 7th, and Light Divisions, with the 5th and 6th and Bradford and
the cavalry in reserve. The blow might have succeeded—but undoubtedly
that delivered four hours later was much more effective.</p>

<p>The idea of an attack at noon having been finally rejected
Wellington turned his mind to another possibility. If Marmont should
commit no blunders, and should continue his turning movement at a safe
distance, and with his whole army well concentrated, it was quite
possible that a retreat might become necessary. The Commander-in-Chief
called up Colonel Delancey, then acting as Adjutant-General<a
id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>, and
directed him to draft a comprehensive scheme for the order in which the
troops should be withdrawn, and the route which each division would
take in the event of an evacuation of the position. The next stand was
to be made, as Marmont had supposed, on the heights above Aldea Tejada,
behind the river Zurgain<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524"
class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. Such a move<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_428">[p. 428]</span> would have involved the abandonment of
the city of Salamanca to the French. The news spread from the staff
round the commanding officers of divisions, and so downwards to the
ranks, where it caused immense discontent. Every one was ‘spoiling
for a fight,’ and the cautious tactics of the last six days had been
causing murmurs, which were only kept from becoming acute by the
long-tried confidence that the army felt in its chief.</p>

<p>At this very moment Marmont began to act in the fashion that
Wellington most desired, by making an altogether dangerous extension
of his left wing, and at the same time pressing in so close to his
adversary that he could not avoid a battle if it were thrust upon him.
His own explanation is that he took the putting off of Wellington’s
tentative movement against Bonnet as a sign that the allied army was
actually commencing its retreat. ‘Wellington renounced his intention
of fighting, and from that moment he had to prepare to draw away, for
if he had remained in his present position I should from the next day
have threatened his communications, by marching on to my left. His
withdrawal commenced at midday.... He had to retreat by his right, and
consequently he had to begin by strengthening his right. He therefore
weakened his left, and accumulated troops on his right. Then his more
distant units and his reserves commenced to move, and in succession
drew off towards Tejares [Aldea Tejada]. His intention was easy to
discern.... The enemy having carried off the bulk of his force to
his right, I had to reinforce my left, so as to be able to act with
promptness and vigour, without having to make new arrangements, when
the moment should arrive for falling upon the English rearguard<a
id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.’</p>

<p>It is clear that the Duke of Ragusa had drawn his conclusion
that Wellington was about to retreat at once, and had argued, from
partly-seen motions in his adversary’s rear, that the whole allied army
was moving off. But this was not yet the case: Wellington was taking
precautions, but he was still not without hope that the French would
commit themselves to some unwise and premature movement. He had still
every man in hand, and the supposed general retreat on Aldea Tejada,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[p. 429]</span> the Marshal
thought that he saw, was in reality only the shifting of reserves more
to the right.</p>

<p>Unwitting of this, Marmont, a little before two o’clock, began his
extension to the left. To the westward of the woods on whose edge the
five divisions composing his main body were massed, is a long plateau
facing the village of Arapiles and the heights behind it. It is about
three-quarters of a mile broad and three miles long, gently undulating
and well suited for marching: in 1812 it seems to have been open
waste: to-day it is mainly under the plough. Its front or northern
side slopes gently down, toward the bottom in which lies the village
of Arapiles: at its back, which is steeper, are woods, outlying parts
of the great forest which extends to Alba de Tormes. It ends suddenly
in a knoll with an outcrop of rock, called the Pico de Miranda, above
the hamlet of Miranda de Azan, from which it draws its name. Along
this plateau was the obvious and easy route for a force marching to
turn Wellington’s right. It was a very tempting piece of ground, with
a glacis-like slope towards the English heights, which made it very
defensible—a better artillery position against a force advancing
from the village of Arapiles and the ridges behind it could not be
conceived. The only danger connected with it seemed to be that it was
over-long—it had more than two miles of front, and a very large force
would be required to hold it securely from end to end. From the Pico
de Miranda, if the French should extend so far, to Foy’s right wing by
Calvarisa de Ariba was a distance of six miles in all—far too much for
an army of 48,000 men in the battle-array of the Napoleonic period.</p>

<p>Marmont says that his first intention was only to occupy the
nearer end of the plateau, that part of it which faces the village of
Arapiles. In his apologetic dispatch to Berthier, he declares that
he wished to get a lodgement upon it, lest Wellington might seize it
before him, and so block his way westward. ‘It was indispensable to
occupy it, seeing that the enemy had just strengthened his centre, from
whence he could push out <i>en masse</i> on to this plateau, and commence
an attack by taking possession of this important ground. Accordingly
I ordered the 5th Division (Maucune) to move out and form up on the
right end of the plateau, where his fire would link on perfectly with
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[p. 430]</span> from the
[Great] Arapile: the 7th Division [Thomières] was to place itself
in second line as a support, the 2nd Division (Clausel) to act as a
reserve to the 7th. The 6th Division (Brennier) was to occupy the high
ground in front of the wood, where a large number of my guns were still
stationed. I ordered General Bonnet at the same time to occupy with the
122nd regiment a knoll intermediate between the plateau and the hill
of the [Great] Arapile, which blocks the exit from the village of the
same name. Finally, I directed General Boyer to leave only one regiment
of his dragoons to watch Foy’s right, and to come round with the other
three to the front of the wood, beside the 2nd Division. The object of
this was that, supposing the enemy should attack the plateau, Boyer
could charge in on their right flank, while my light cavalry could
charge in on their left flank<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526"
class="fnanchor">[526]</a>.’</p>

<p>All this reads very plausibly and ingeniously, but unfortunately
it squares in neither with the psychology of the moment, nor with the
manœuvres which Maucune, Thomières, and Clausel executed, under the
Marshal’s eye and without his interference. He had forgotten when
he dictated this paragraph—and not unnaturally, for he wrote sorely
wounded, on his sick-bed, in pain, and with his head not too clear—that
he had just before stated that Wellington was obviously retreating,
and had begun to withdraw towards Aldea Tejada. If this was so, how
could he possibly have conceived at the moment that his adversary,
far from retreating, was preparing an offensive movement <i>en masse</i>
against the left flank of the French position? The two conceptions
cannot be reconciled. The fact was, undoubtedly, that he thought that
Wellington was moving off, and pushed forward Maucune, Thomières, and
Clausel, with the object of molesting and detaining what he supposed
to be the rearguard of his adversary. The real idea of the moment was
the one which appears in the paragraph of his <i>Mémoires</i>, already
quoted on an <a href="#score">earlier page</a>: ‘I hoped that our
respective positions would bring on not a battle but an advantageous
rearguard action, in which, using my full force late in the day,
with a part only of the British army left in front of me, I should
probably score a point.’ Jourdan, a severe critic of his colleague,
puts the matter with perfect frankness in his <i>Guerre d’Espagne</i>.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span> After quoting Marmont’s
insincere dispatch at length, he adds, ‘it is evident that the Marshal,
in order to menace the point of retreat of the allies, extended
his left much too far<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527"
class="fnanchor">[527]</a>.’ Napoleon, after reading Marmont’s
dispatch in a Russian bivouac<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528"
class="fnanchor">[528]</a>, pronounced that all his reasons and
explanations for the position into which he got himself had ‘as much
complicated stuffing as the inside of a clock, and not a word of truth
as to the real state of things.’</p>

<p>What happened under the eyes of Marmont, as he took a long-delayed
lunch on the top of the Greater Arapile<a id="FNanchor_529"
href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>, was as follows.
Maucune, with his strong division of nine battalions or 5,200 men,
after breaking out from the position in front of the woods where the
French main body was massed, marched across the open ground for about
a mile or more, till he had got well on to the central part of the
plateau which he was directed to occupy. He then drew up opposite the
village of Arapiles, and sent out his voltigeur companies to work down
the slope toward that place, which lay well in front of the British
line. The position which he took up was on that part of the plateau
which sweeps forward nearest to the opposite heights, and is little
more than half a mile from them. A fierce artillery engagement then
set in: Maucune’s divisional battery began to shell the village of
Arapiles. Sympher’s battery, belonging to the 4th Division, replied
from the slope behind the village and from two guns on the Lesser
Arapile. The French pieces which had been dragged up on to the Greater
Arapile then started shelling the Lesser, and silenced the two guns
there, which were drawn off, and sent to rejoin the rest of the
battery, on a less exposed position. The 3/27th on the hilltop had to
take cover behind rocks as best it could. Soon after at least two more
French batteries, from the artillery reserve, took ground to the right
of Maucune, and joined in the shelling of the village of Arapiles.
Wellington presently supported Sympher’s battery with that of Lawson,
belonging to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[p. 432]</span>
5th Division, which turned on to shell Maucune’s supporting columns
from ground on the lower slopes, not far to the right of Sympher’s
position. The effect was good, and the columns shifted sideways to get
out of range. But one [or perhaps two] of the French batteries then
shifted their position, and began to play upon Lawson diagonally from
the left, so enfilading him that he was ordered to limber up and move
higher on the hill behind the village, from whence he resumed his fire.
Wellington also, a little later, brought up the horse-artillery troop
belonging to the 7th Division [’E’, Macdonald’s troop] and placed it
on the Lesser Arapile—two guns on the summit, four on the lower slopes
near the 1/40th of W. Anson’s brigade. The British fire all along the
heights was effective and accurate, but quite unable to cope with that
of the French, who had apparently six batteries in action against
three. Marmont, indeed, had all along his line an immense superiority
of guns, having 78 pieces with him against Wellington’s 54. His
artillery-reserve consisted of four batteries—that of his adversary of
one only—Arriaga’s Portuguese 24-pounder howitzers<a id="FNanchor_530"
href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>.</p>

<p>While Maucune and the French artillery were making a very noisy
demonstration against the British line between the Lesser Arapile and
the village of the same name, which looked like the preliminaries of
a serious attack, more troops emerged from the woods of Marmont’s
centre, and began to file along the plateau, under cover of Maucune’s
deployed line. These were Thomières’s division, succeeded after a long
interval by that of Clausel. ‘During the cannonade column followed
column in quick and continued succession along the heights occupied
by the enemy: Marmont was moving his army in battle-order along his
position, and gaining ground rapidly to his left<a id="FNanchor_531"
href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>.’ According to the
Marshal’s own account of his intentions, he had proposed to place
Maucune on the (French) right end of the plateau, Thomières and Clausel
in support of him. What happened, however, was that Maucune went well
forward on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[p. 433]</span> the
right-centre of the plateau, and that Thomières marched along past
Maucune’s rear, and continued moving in a westerly direction along the
summit of the plateau, though Clausel soon halted: before Thomières
stopped he had gone nearly three miles. It is clear that if Marmont
had chosen, he could have checked the manœuvres of his subordinates,
the moment that they passed the limit which he alleges that he had set
them. An aide-de-camp sent down from the back of the Greater Arapile
could have told Maucune not to press forward toward the English
position, or Thomières to stop his march, within a matter of twenty
minutes or half an hour. No such counterorders were sent—and the reason
clearly was that Marmont was satisfied with the movements that he saw
proceeding before him, until the moment when he suddenly realized with
dismay that Wellington was about to deliver a counter-stroke in full
force.</p>

<p>We must now turn to the movements of the allied army. The instant
that Maucune deployed on the plateau in front of the village of
Arapiles, and that the cannonade began, Wellington judged that he was
about to be attacked—the thing that he most desired. A very few orders
put his army in a defensive battle-position. The 5th Division was sent
from the rear side of the heights to occupy the crest, continuing the
line of the 4th Division. The 6th Division was brought up from the rear
to a position behind the 4th. The 7th Division, abandoning the long
bickering with Foy in which its light troops had been engaged, was
drawn back from the left wing, and took post in second line parallel to
the 6th and in rear of the 5th Division. The place of its skirmishers
on the slopes in front of Nuestra Señora de la Peña was taken by some
companies of the 95th, sent out from the Light Division. That unit and
the 1st Division now formed the total of the allied left wing, with
Bock’s heavy dragoons covering their flank. They were ‘containing’ an
equivalent French force—Foy’s and Ferey’s infantry divisions, and the
single regiment of Boyer’s dragoons which Marmont had left in this
quarter.</p>

<p>There still remained in reserve, near the village of Las Torres,
Bradford’s Portuguese and España’s Spanish battalions, with the bulk of
the allied cavalry—all Anson’s and Le Marchant’s<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_434">[p. 434]</span> and the greater part of Arentschildt’s
squadrons, and in addition Pakenham and D’Urban were available a little
farther to the right, near Aldea Tejada. If the French were going to
attack the heights on each side of the village of Arapiles, as seemed
probable at the moment, all these remoter reserves could be used as
should seem most profitable.</p>

<p>But the battle did not go exactly as Wellington expected. The
cannonade continued, and Maucune’s skirmishing line pushed very
boldly forward, and actually attacked the village of Arapiles,
which was defended by the light companies of the Guards’ brigade of
the 1st Division and of the Fusilier brigade of the 4th Division.
The <i>voltigeurs</i> twice seized the southern outlying houses of the
straggling village, and were twice driven out. But the battalions
in support of them did not come forward, nor did Bonnet attack on
the right of them, nor Thomières on the left. The former remained
stationary, on and about the Great Arapile: the latter continued to
march westward along the plateau: a perceptible gap began to appear
between him and Maucune.</p>

<p>Wellington at this moment was toward the right rear of his
own line—occupied according to some authorities in snatching a
late and hasty lunch<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532"
class="fnanchor">[532]</a> while matters were developing, but not yet
developed—according to others in giving orders concerning the cavalry
to Stapleton Cotton, near Las Torres—when he received an urgent message
from Leith. It said that Maucune had ceased to advance, but that
the French extreme left was still in march westward. ‘On being made
acquainted with the posture of affairs,’ writes the officer who bore
Leith’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[p. 435]</span> report<a
id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>,
‘Lord Wellington declared his intention of riding to the spot and
directed me to accompany him. When he arrived at the ground of the
5th Division—now under arms and perfectly prepared to receive the
attack, his Lordship found the enemy still in the same formation,
but not displaying any intention of trying his fortune, by crossing
the valley at that point. He soon became satisfied that no operation
of consequence was intended against this part of the line. He again
galloped off toward the right, which at this time became the most
interesting and important scene of action.’</p>

<p>The critical moment of the day was the short space of time when
Wellington was surveying the French army, from the height where
Leith’s men were lying prostrate behind the crest, above the village
of Arapiles, under a distant but not very effective artillery fire.
The whole plateau opposite was very visible: Maucune could be seen
halted and in line, with much artillery on his flank, but no infantry
force near—there was half a mile between him and Bonnet. Thomières was
still pushing away to his left, already separated by some distance
from Maucune. Clausel had apparently halted after the end of his march
out of the woods. Foy and Ferey were at least two miles off to the
French right. The enemy, in short, were in no solid battle order,
and were scattered on an immense arc, which enveloped on both sides
the obtuse angle <i>en potence</i> formed by the main body of the allied
army. From Foy’s right to Thomières’s left there was length but no
depth. The only reserves were the troops imperfectly visible in the
woods behind the Great Arapile—where lay Brennier in first line, and
Sarrut who was now nearing Marmont’s artillery-park and baggage.
Their strength might be guessed from the fact that Marmont was known
to have eight infantry divisions, and that six were clearly visible
elsewhere. Wellington’s determination was suddenly taken, to turn what
had been intended for a defensive into an offensive battle. Seeing
the enemy so scattered, and so entirely out of regular formation, he
would attack him with the whole force that he had in position west of
the little Arapile, before Marmont could get into order. Leith, Cole,
and Pack in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[p. 436]</span>
line, supported by the 6th and 7th Divisions in second line, and
with Bradford, España, and Stapleton Cotton’s cavalry covering their
right flank in a protective échelon, should cross the valley and fall
upon Bonnet, Maucune, Clausel, and Thomières. Meanwhile Pakenham and
D’Urban, being in a hidden position from which they could easily
outflank Thomières, should ascend the western end of the plateau, get
across the head of his marching column, and drive it in upon Maucune,
whom Leith would be assailing at the same moment. Pakenham’s turning
movement was the most delicate part of the plan; wherefore Wellington
resolved to start it himself. He rode like the wind across the ground
behind the heights, past Las Torres and Penilla, and appeared all
alone before D’Urban’s Portuguese squadrons. It was only some time
later that first Colonel Delancey and then others of his staff, quite
outdistanced, came dropping in with blown horses. The orders to D’Urban
were short and clear: Pakenham was about to attack the western end of
the plateau where Thomières was moving—near the Pico de Miranda. It
would be D’Urban’s duty to cover his right flank<a id="FNanchor_534"
href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. A minute later
Wellington was before the 3rd Division, which had just received orders
to stand to its arms.</p>

<p>‘The officers had not taken their places in the column, but
were in a group together, in front of it. As Lord Wellington rode
up to Pakenham every eye was turned towards him. He looked paler
than usual; but, notwithstanding the sudden change he had just
made in the disposition of his army, he was quite unruffled in his
manner, as if the battle to be fought was nothing but a field-day.
His words were few and his orders brief. Tapping Pakenham on the
shoulder, he said, “Edward, move on with the 3rd Division, take
those heights in your front—and drive everything before you.” “I
will, my lord,” was the laconic reply of the gallant Sir Edward.
A moment after, Lord Wellington was galloping on to the next
division, to give (I suppose) orders to the same effect, and in
less than half an hour the battle had commenced<a id="FNanchor_535"
href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>.’ The time was about
a quarter to four in the afternoon.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_437">[p. 437]</span></p> <p>Having set Pakenham and D’Urban
in motion, Wellington rode back to the ground of the 5th Division,
sending on his way orders for Arentschildt to leave the cavalry
reserve, and join D’Urban with the five squadrons that remained of
Victor Alten’s brigade<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536"
class="fnanchor">[536]</a>. Bradford, España, and Cotton at the same
time were directed to come forward to Leith’s right flank. On reaching
the hilltop behind the village of Arapiles, the Commander-in-Chief
gave his orders to Leith: the 5th Division was to advance downhill and
attack Maucune across the valley, as soon as Bradford’s Portuguese
should be close up to support his right, and as Pakenham’s distant
movement should become visible. Wellington then rode on to give the
corresponding orders to Cole, more to the left<a id="FNanchor_537"
href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>.</p>

<p>The 5th Division thereupon sent out its light companies in
skirmishing line, and came up to the crest: the two neighbouring
brigades of the 4th Division followed suit, and then Pack’s Portuguese,
opposite the Greater Arapile. Considerable loss was suffered in all
these corps from the French artillery fire, when the battalions rose
from their lying posture behind the crest and became visible. Some
thirty or forty minutes elapsed between Wellington’s arrival on the
scene and the commencement of the advance: the delay was caused by
the necessity for waiting for Bradford, who was coming up as fast as
possible from Las Torres. The attack did not begin till about 4.40
p.m.</p>

<p>By the time that Leith and Cole came into action the French army
had been deprived of its chief. Somewhere between three and four
o’clock in the afternoon<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538"
class="fnanchor">[538]</a>, and certainly nearer the latter than the
former hour, Marmont had been severely wounded. According to his own
narrative he had begun to be troubled by seeing Maucune pressing in
too close to the village of Arapiles, and Thomières passing on too
far to the left, and had been roused to considerable vexation by
getting a message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[p. 438]</span>
from the former that he observed that the troops in front of him were
retiring, and therefore would ask leave to support his <i>voltigeurs</i>
and attack the British position with his whole division. Marmont
says that it was his wish to stop Maucune from closing that induced
him to prepare to depart from his eyrie on the Great Arapile, and to
descend to take charge of his left wing. Be this as it may, there
is no doubt that he was starting to climb down and mount his horse,
when a shell from one of Dyneley’s two guns on the British Arapile
burst near him, and flung him to the ground with a lacerated right
arm, and a wound in his side which broke two ribs<a id="FNanchor_539"
href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>. He himself says
that there was nothing irremediable in the state of his army at the
moment that he was disabled. His critic, Foy, held otherwise. ‘The
Duke of Ragusa,’ he wrote, ‘insinuated that the battle of the 22nd
was lost because, after his own wounding, there was a gap in the
command, anarchy, and disorder. But it was the Duke who forced on the
battle, and that contrary to the advice of General Clausel. His left
was already beaten when he was disabled: already it was impossible
either to refuse a battle or to give it a good turn. It was only
possible to attenuate the disaster—and that was what Clausel did<a
id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>.’
Foy also insinuates that Maucune’s advance, at least in its early
stages, was consonant with Marmont’s intentions. ‘He had made his
arrangements for a decisive blow: when the English were seen to take
up their position, the heads of the columns were turned to the left,
so as to occupy the elevations which dominate the plain, and swell
up one after another. The occupation of one led to the temptation
to seize the next, and so by advance after advance the village of
Arapiles was at last reached. Maucune’s division actually held it for
some minutes. Nevertheless we had not yet made up our minds to deliver
battle, and the necessary dispositions for one had not been made. My
division was still occupying the plateau of Calvarisa, with the 3rd
and 4th Divisions (Ferey and Sarrut) and the dragoons supporting<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[p. 439]</span> me in the rear. Here,
then, was a whole section of the army quite out of the fight: and the
other divisions were not well linked together, and could be beaten one
after the other.’</p>

<p>Foy is certainly correct in asserting that, at the moment of the
Marshal’s wound, he himself and Ferey were too far off to be brought
up in time to save Maucune, and that Bonnet, Maucune, Clausel, and
Thomières were in no solid connexion with each other. This indeed
was what made Wellington deliver his attack. It is probable that the
Marshal’s wound occurred just about the moment (3.45) when Pakenham
and D’Urban were being directed by Wellington to advance. Even if it
fell a trifle earlier, the French left wing was already too dislocated
to have time to get into a good position before it was attacked.
Marmont, it must be confessed, rather gave away his case when, in his
reply to Napoleon’s angry query why he had fought a battle on the
22nd, he answered that he had not intended to deliver a general action
at all—it had been forced on him by Wellington<a id="FNanchor_541"
href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>. If so, he was
responsible for being caught by his adversary with his army strung
out in such a fashion that it had a very poor chance of avoiding
disaster. If it be granted that the unlucky shell had never struck him,
it would not have been in ‘a quarter of an hour<a id="FNanchor_542"
href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>’ (as he himself
pretends), nor even in a whole hour, that he could have rearranged
a line six miles long<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543"
class="fnanchor">[543]</a>, though he might have stopped Maucune’s
attack and Thomières’s flank march in a much shorter time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[p. 440]</span>On Marmont’s
fall, the command of the army of Portugal fell to Bonnet, the senior
general of division. He was within a few yards of his wounded chief,
since his division was holding the Great Arapile, and took up the
charge at once. But it was an extraordinary piece of ill-luck for the
French that Bonnet also was wounded within an hour, so that the command
passed to Clausel before six o’clock. As Foy remarks, however, no one
could have saved the compromised left wing—Marmont had let it get into
a thoroughly vicious position before he was disabled.</p>

<p>Since the main clash of the battle of Salamanca started at the
western end of the field, it will be best to begin the narrative of
the British advance with the doings of Pakenham and D’Urban. These two
officers had some two miles of rough ground to cover between the point
where Wellington had parted from them, and the point which had now been
reached by the head of the French advance. They were ordered to move
in four ‘columns of lines,’ with D’Urban’s cavalry forming the two
outer or right-hand columns, the third composed of Wallace’s brigade
(1/45th, 1/88th, 74th) and of Power’s Portuguese (9th and 21st Line
and 12th Caçadores), while the fourth consisted of Campbell’s brigade
(1/5th, 2/5th, 94th, 2/83rd). The object of this formation was that
the division, when it came into action, should be able to deploy into
two lines, without the delay that would have been caused if the third
brigade had followed in the wake of the other two<a id="FNanchor_544"
href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.</p>

<p>The way in which the two sides came into collision was rather
peculiar. Thomières’s column was accompanied by the whole, or nearly
the whole, of Curto’s light cavalry division, which, as one would have
supposed, would naturally have been keeping a squadron or so in advance
to explore the way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[p. 441]</span>
as well as others on the flanks to cover the infantry. But it appears
that this simple precaution was not taken, for Pakenham and D’Urban
met no French cavalry at all, till they had got well in touch with
the hostile infantry. Curto, we must suppose, was marching parallel
with the centre, not certainly with the head, of Thomières’s division,
without any vedettes or exploring parties in front. For D’Urban
describes the first meeting as follows:—</p>

<p>‘The enemy was marching by his left along the wooded heights, which
form the southern boundary of the valley of the Arapiles, and the
western extremity of which closes in a lower fall, which descends upon
the little stream of the Azan, near the village of Miranda. As the head
of our column approached this lower fall, or hill, skirting it near its
base, and having it on our left, we became aware that we were close to
the enemy, though we could not see them owing to the trees, the dust,
and the peculiar configuration of the ground. Anxious, therefore,
to ascertain their exact whereabouts I had ridden out a little in
front, having with me, I think, only my brigade-major Flangini and
Da Camara, when upon clearing the verge of a small clump of trees,
a short way up the slope, I came suddenly upon the head of a French
column of infantry, having about a company in front, and marching very
fast by its left. It was at once obvious that, as the columns of the
3rd Division were marching on our left, the French must be already
beyond their right, and consequently I ought to attack at once<a
id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>.’</p>

<p>This was apparently the leading battalion of the French 101st,
marching with its front absolutely uncovered by either cavalry vedettes
or any exploring parties of its own. D’Urban galloped back, unseen
by the enemy, and wheeled his leading regiment, the 1st Portuguese
dragoons—three weak squadrons of little over 200 sabres—into line,
with orders to charge the French battalion, before it should take the
alarm and form square. The 11th Portuguese, and two squadrons of the
British 14th Light Dragoons, which had only just arrived on the ground,
being the foremost part of Arentschildt’s brigade, followed in support.
The charge was successful—the French were so much taken by surprise
that the only manœuvre they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[p.
442]</span> were able to perform was to close their second company
upon the first, so that their front was six deep. The two squadrons
of the Portuguese which attacked frontally suffered severe loss,
their colonel, Watson, falling severely wounded among the French
bayonets. But the right-hand squadron, which overlapped the French
left, broke in almost unopposed on the unformed flank of the battalion,
which then went to pieces, and was chased uphill by the whole of
the Portuguese horsemen, losing many prisoners<a id="FNanchor_546"
href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>.</p>

<p>This sudden assault on his leading unit, which seems to have been
acting as an advanced guard, and was considerably ahead of the next,
must have been sufficiently startling to Thomières, who was taken
wholly unawares. But the next moment brought worse trouble: the first
brigade of the 3rd Division—Wallace’s—emerged almost simultaneously
with the cavalry charge from the scattered trees which had hitherto
covered its advance, and was seen coming uphill in beautiful order
against him. He was caught in a long column—battalion marching behind
battalion, with considerable intervals between the regiments, of which
there were three (101st, three battalions; 62nd, two battalions;
1st, three battalions)<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. If he was able to see Pakenham’s supporting
lines, which is a little doubtful, Thomières must have known that
he was considerably outnumbered: the British division had 5,800
men against his 4,500, while Curto’s 1,800 light cavalry were not
forthcoming at the critical moment to save the situation.</p>

<p>The space between the advancing line of Wallace’s brigade and
the head of the French column, when they came in sight of each
other, was about 1,000 yards—the time that it took to bring them
into collision just sufficed to enable Thomières to make some sort
of hasty disposition of his battalions: those in the rear pushed
out on to the flanks of the leading regiment,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_443">[p. 443]</span> and made an irregular line of columns
badly spaced. The <i>voltigeurs</i> of each battalion had time to run to
the front: ‘their light troops,’ says a witness from the Connaught
Rangers, ‘hoping to take advantage of the time which our deploying
from column into line would take, ran down the face of the hill in a
state of great excitement.’ Pakenham appears to have sent out against
them his three companies of the 5/60th and the whole of the 12th
Caçadores, a skirmishing line of superior strength. Wallace’s three
battalions formed line from open column without halting, when they had
got to within 250 yards of the enemy: ‘the different companies, by
throwing forward their right shoulders, were in line without the slow
manœuvre of a deployment.’ The French fire is said to have been rather
ineffective, because delivered downhill. The most serious loss was that
caused by Thomières’s divisional battery, which got up and into action
very promptly. It was answered by Douglas’s battery, the divisional
artillery of the 3rd Division, which unlimbered on a knoll at the edge
of the wood, and sent a raking discharge uphill, against the right
of the French division, shelling it over the heads of the brigade
advancing up the slope. The two Portuguese line regiments, from the
rear of Wallace’s brigade, formed in support of him: Campbell’s brigade
followed as a third line.</p>

<p>The main body of the French<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548"
class="fnanchor">[548]</a> stood in a group, rather than a line, of
battalion columns near the brow of the hill, while Wallace’s brigade
continued to press upwards with a front which outflanked the enemy
at both ends. ‘Regardless of the fire of the <i>tirailleurs</i>, and the
shower of grape and canister, the brigade continued to press onward.
The centre (88th regiment) suffered, but still advanced, the right
and left (l/45th and 74th) continued to go forward at a more rapid
pace, and as the wings inclined forward and outstripped the centre,
the brigade assumed the form of a crescent<a id="FNanchor_549"
href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>.’ They were nearly at
the brow, when Thomières directed the French columns to charge down in
support of his <i>tirailleurs</i>. The mass, with drums beating and loud
shouts of <i>Vive l’Empereur</i>, ran forward, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_444">[p. 444]</span> the leading files delivered a heavy fire,
which told severely on the 88th. But on coming under fire in return the
French halted, and then wavered: ‘their second discharge was unlike
the first—it was irregular and ill-directed, the men acted without
concert or method: many fired in the air.’ The three British battalions
then cheered and advanced, when the enemy, his columns already in much
confusion and mixed with the wrecks of his <i>tirailleurs</i>, gave way
completely, and went off in confusion along the top of the plateau.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Curto’s <i>chasseurs</i> at last appeared—where
they had been up to this moment does not appear, but certainly not
in their proper place. Now, however, six or seven squadrons of them
came trotting up on the outer flank of the broken division, of whom
some charged the two battalions which formed the right of Pakenham’s
first and third lines—the 1/45th and 1/5th respectively. The former,
feebly attacked, threw back some companies <i>en potence</i> and beat off
their assailants easily. The latter fell back some little way, and had
many men cut up, but finally rallied in a clump and were not broken<a
id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>.
Their assailants disappeared a moment after, being driven off by
Arentschildt, who had just come up on Pakenham’s right with the
five squadrons of the 1st Hussars K.G.L. and 14th Light Dragoons<a
id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>.
D’Urban’s Portuguese were now a little to the rear, rallying after
their successful charge and collecting prisoners: their commander says
in his narrative of this part of the battle that he never saw any
French cavalry till later in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[p.
445]</span> the day, but does not dispute that the 5th may have been
attacked by them without his knowledge.</p>

<p>Curto’s cavalry being driven off, the 3rd Division and its attendant
squadrons pursued the broken French division of infantry along the top
of the plateau, and very nearly annihilated it. Thomières was killed,
his divisional battery was captured whole; of his two leading regiments
the 101st Line lost 1,031 men out of 1,449 present: its colonel and
eagle were both taken with many hundred unwounded prisoners: the 62nd
Line lost 868 men out of 1,123. The rear regiment, the 1st Line,
got off with the comparatively trifling casualty-list of 231 out
of 1,743: it was possibly not up in time to take part in resisting
Pakenham’s first attack, and may perhaps have done no more than cover
the retreat of the wrecks of the two leading regiments. The whole
division was out of action as a fighting body for the rest of the day,
having lost 2,130 men out of a little over 4,500.<a id="FNanchor_552"
href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The victorious British
3rd Division, whose casualties had not amounted to more than 500 of
all ranks, continued to press the fugitives before it, till it had
gone a mile, and came in on the flank of Maucune’s division, the next
unit in the French line; D’Urban’s cavalry accompanied it close on its
right flank, Arentschildt’s squadrons lay farther out, watching Curto’s
defeated first brigade of <i>chasseurs</i>, which rallied upon a reserve,
his second brigade, and made head once more against the pursuers, just
about the same time that Pakenham’s infantry began again to meet with
resistance.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER VII">SECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER VII</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE BATTLE OF SALAMANCA: THE MAIN ENGAGEMENT</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We must</span> now turn from the exploits of
Pakenham and the 3rd Division to deal with the great central attack of
Wellington’s frontal striking force, the 5th and 4th Divisions, under
Leith and Cole, upon the French left centre. They had been told to move
on when Bradford’s Portuguese brigade should be sufficiently near to
cover the right flank of the 5th Division, and the necessity of waiting
for this support caused their attack to be delivered perceptibly later
than that of Pakenham. Leith had drawn out his division in two lines,
the first consisting of Greville’s brigade (3/1st, 1/9th, and both
battalions of the 38th) and the first battalion of the 4th, brought
up from the rear brigade (Pringle’s) to equalize the front of the two
lines: the second consisted of the rest of that brigade (the second
battalion of the 4th, the 2/30th, and 2/44th) and the Portuguese of
Spry (3rd and 15th Line). There was a heavy skirmishing line in front,
composed of all the British light companies and the 8th Caçadores<a
id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>.
Cole had a smaller force, as his left brigade (Anson’s) had been told
off to the defence of the British Arapile: the 3/27th was holding that
rocky knoll, the 1/40th was at its foot in support. Only therefore the
Fusilier brigade (under Ellis of the 23rd) and Stubbs’s Portuguese
formed the attacking force. They were in a single line of seven
battalions, with a heavy skirmishing screen composed of four light
companies and the whole of the 7th Caçadores<a id="FNanchor_554"
href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>. The Fusilier brigade
of the 4th Division went through the end of the village of Arapiles,
which it did by files from the right of companies, the companies
forming up again on the east side of the place, upon their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[p. 447]</span> sergeants regularly sent
out as markers. This defile delayed the advance of the division, which
therefore attacked decidedly later than Leith’s men, the joint movement
being in an échelon, with the right leading and the left considerably
refused. It was obvious that when the 4th Division drew near to the
French line on the plateau, it would be exposing its left flank to the
hostile division (Bonnet’s) which was massed on and near the Greater
Arapile. Wellington had noted this, and had given special discretionary
orders to Pack, directing him to use his independent brigade for the
sole purpose of protecting the near flank of the 4th Division; he might
attack the Arapile, as the best means of holding back Bonnet from
descending against Cole’s line, or might manœuvre below the knoll for
the same purpose. When the dangerous moment came, Pack, as we shall
see, took the bull by the horns, and assailed the precipitous height in
front with his whole 2,000 men.</p>

<p>In the rear of the 4th Division the 6th was now coming up the back
slope of the hill behind the Arapile in second line: similarly the 7th
Division was following the 5th. To the right of the 7th, Stapleton
Cotton was moving up from Las Torres with the cavalry reserve, now
consisting only of the six regiments of Le Marchant and G. Anson.
Bradford, more to the right still, and not yet in line with Leith and
Cole, moved with España’s small Spanish division behind him.</p>

<p>Of Wellington’s front line Leith with the 5th Division had Maucune
in front of him: Cole would have to deal with Clausel, who had arrived
late on the ground, and was only just taking up his position on the
extreme right end of the French plateau. Pack and W. Anson’s detached
brigade from the 4th Division, with the Lesser Arapile in their
power, looked across the valley at Bonnet, massed around its greater
twin-hill. The British attacking line was amply provided with reserves:
the defensive line of the French was still very thin, though Brennier’s
division was hurrying up from the head of the wood to support Maucune.
Sarrut’s division was still invisible in the forest far to the rear:
Ferey’s was better seen—it was hastening up across the open ground on
its way from the extreme French right, but must obviously be too late
to join in meeting Wellington’s first attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[p. 448]</span>The roar of the
cannon and musketry away in the direction of the Pico de Miranda had
been announcing for some time that Pakenham was at close grips with
Thomières, before Leith marched down from his heights to cross the
valley that separated him from Maucune’s position. Soon after five,
however, the 5th Division was in close contact with the enemy, having
suffered a considerable amount of casualties in reaching him, mainly
from the very superior French artillery fire, which swept every yard
of the glacis-like slope that ascends from the bottom of the Arapiles
valley to the brow of the plateau that forms its southern limit.</p>

<p>‘The ground,’ writes Leith Hay, ‘between the advancing force and
that which it was to assail was crowded by the light troops of both
sides in extended order, carrying on a very incessant <i>tiraillade</i>.
The general desired me to ride forward, to make our light infantry
press up the heights to cover his line of march, and to bid them, if
practicable, make a rush at the enemy’s guns. Our light troops soon
drove in those opposed to them: the cannon were removed to the rear:
every obstruction to the general advance of our line vanished. In front
of the centre of that beautiful line rode General Leith, directing its
movements. Occasionally every soldier was visible, the sun shining
bright upon their arms, though at intervals all were enveloped in a
dense cloud of dust, from whence at times issued the animating cheer of
the British infantry.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">‘The French columns, retired from the crest of the
heights, were formed in squares, about fifty yards behind the line at
which, when arrived, the British regiments would become visible. Their
artillery, although placed more to the rear, still poured its fire
upon our advancing troops. We were now near the summit of the ridge.
The men marched with the same orderly steadiness as at the first: no
advance in line at a review was ever more correctly executed: the
dressing was admirable, and the gaps caused by casualties were filled
up with the most perfect regularity. General Leith and the officers of
his staff, being on horseback, first perceived the enemy, and had time
to observe his formation, before our infantry line became so visible
as to induce him to commence firing. He was drawn up in contiguous
squares, the front rank kneeling, and prepared<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_449">[p. 449]</span> to fire when the drum should beat. All
was still and quiet in these squares: not a musket was discharged until
the whole opened. Nearly at the same instant General Leith ordered our
line to fire and charge. At this moment the last thing I saw through
the smoke was the plunge of the horse of Colonel Greville, commanding
the leading brigade, who, shot through the head, reared and fell back
on his rider. In an instant every individual present was enveloped in
smoke and obscurity. No serious struggle for ascendancy followed, for
the French squares were penetrated, broken, and discomfited, and the
victorious 5th Division pressed forward no longer against troops formed
up, but against a mass of disorganized men flying in all directions....
When close to the enemy’s squares Leith had been severely wounded and
reluctantly forced to quit the field; at the same moment I was hit
myself, and my horse killed by a musket-ball: thus removed, I cannot
detail the further movements of the division<a id="FNanchor_555"
href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>.’</p>

<p>In this clear and simple narrative the most remarkable point is
Leith Hay’s distinct statement that the French received the charge
of the 5th Division in a line of squares, a most strange formation
to adopt against infantry advancing deployed, even when it was
supplemented by a strong screen of <i>tirailleurs</i>, and flanked by
several batteries of artillery. It is possible that Maucune adopted it
because, from his commanding position on the plateau, he could see a
considerable body of cavalry coming up on Leith’s right rear. This was
composed of the brigades of Le Marchant and G. Anson, which Stapleton
Cotton was bringing up to the front by Wellington’s orders. While Leith
was advancing they pressed forward, Le Marchant leading, and passed
up the hill in the interval between the 5th Division and Pakenham’s
front—leaving behind them Bradford, who had crossed the valley parallel
to, but much behind, the right of Leith. Bradford had no solid body
of troops in front of him, being outside Maucune’s extreme left, and
suffered practically no loss—the total casualty list of his brigade
that day was only seventeen men. This contrasts marvellously with
the loss of Leith’s front line, where Greville’s brigade in their
triumphant advance lost 350 men—mainly from the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_450">[p. 450]</span> artillery fire endured while the long
slope of the French plateau was being mounted: for there were at least
four batteries aligned on Maucune’s right, and their guns had been
worked till the last possible minute.</p>

<p>Whatever was the cause of the formation in square adopted by the
French division, it would have been fortunate if only it could have
preserved that formation a little longer; for precisely when it had
lost its order, and fallen back before Leith’s shattering volleys of
musketry, Le Marchant’s heavy dragoons arrived upon the crest of the
plateau. No better opportunity for the use of cavalry could have been
conceived, than that which existed at this moment. Infantry already
engaged with, and worsted by, other infantry is the destined prey
of cavalry coming on the scene from the flank in unbroken order. Le
Marchant had received his instructions directly from Wellington,
who had told him to ‘charge in at all hazards<a id="FNanchor_556"
href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>,’ when he saw the
French battalions on the plateau hotly engaged. He had formed his 1,000
sabres in two lines, the 5th Dragoon Guards and 4th Dragoons in front,
the 3rd Dragoons in support, and had come over the sky-line and trotted
down into the valley just as Leith’s division got to close quarters
with Maucune. Passing Bradford on his right, he came to the crest to
find all confusion in front of him. The squares that Leith had just
broken were rolling back in disorder: directly behind a new division
(Brennier’s), only just arriving upon the field, was beginning to form
up, to cover and support the shaken battalions. Some distance to their
left rear the remains of Thomières’s division, in a disorderly crowd,
were falling back in front of the triumphant advance of Pakenham.</p>

<p>Le Marchant charged in diagonally upon the flank of Maucune’s left
brigade, and caught the two battalions of the 66th regiment falling
back from the crest. The Frenchmen were courageous enough to make a
desperate attempt to club themselves together in a solid mass: their
rear ranks faced about and opened a heavy fire upon the advancing
squadrons. But it was given with uncertain aim and trifling effect,
and before they could reload the dragoons were among them.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[p. 451]</span> A desperate minority
attempted to resist with the bayonet, and were sabred: some hundreds
cast down their muskets, raised their hands, and asked quarter. The
rear ranks scattered and fled southward across the plateau. Leaving the
gathering up of the prisoners to the infantry of Leith, Le Marchant
led his brigade, so soon as some order could be restored, against the
next regiment of Maucune’s division, the 15th Line; they were better
prepared for resistance than the 66th, which had been caught quite
unawares, they showed a regular front, and gave a more effective fire.
Many of the dragoons fell; but nevertheless their impetus carried them
through the mass, which went to pieces and dispersed into a disorderly
crowd: it fled in the same direction as the wrecks of the 66th.</p>

<p>Le Marchant’s brigade had now lost its formation, ‘the three
regiments had become mixed together, the officers rode where they could
find places: but a good front, without intervals, was still maintained,
and there was no confusion<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557"
class="fnanchor">[557]</a>.’ In front of them there was now a fresh
enemy—the 22nd Line, the leading regiment of the division of Brennier,
which had just arrived on the field, and was getting into order to
save and support Maucune’s routed battalions. It would seem that in
the midst of the dust and smoke, and surrounded and interfered with
by the fugitives of the broken regiments, the 22nd had either no
time or no good opportunity for forming squares: they were found in
<i>colonne serrée</i>, in good order, partly covered by a clump of trees,
an outlying thicket from the great forest to their rear. They reserved
their fire, with great composure, till the dragoons were within ten
yards distance, and poured a volley so close and well aimed upon the
leading squadron [5th Dragoon Guards] that nearly a fourth of them
fell. Tremendous as was the effect of the discharge, the dragoons
were not arrested: they broke in through the opposing bayonets, and
plunged into the dense masses of the enemy. In the combat which ensued,
broadsword and bayonet were used against each other with various
results: the French, hewn down and trampled under the horses’ feet,
offered all the resistance that brave men could make. Le Marchant
himself had some narrow escapes—he fought like a private, and had to
cut down more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[p. 452]</span> than
one of the enemy. It was only after a fierce struggle that the French
yielded, and he had the satisfaction of seeing them fly before him in
helpless confusion. The brigade had now lost all order: the dragoons,
excited by the struggle, vied with each other in the pursuit, and
galloped recklessly into the crowd of fugitives, sabring those who
came within their reach. To restrain them at such a moment was beyond
the power of their officers<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558"
class="fnanchor">[558]</a>.’</p>

<p>Le Marchant endeavoured to keep a few men in hand, in order to
guard against any attempt of the French to rally, but he had only
about half a squadron of the 4th Dragoons with him, when he came upon
some companies which were beginning to re-form in the edge of the
great wood. He led his party against them, and drove them back among
the trees, where they dispersed. But at the moment of contact he was
shot dead, by a ball which entered his groin and broke his spine.
Thus fell an officer of whom great things had been expected by all
who knew him, in the moment when he had just obtained and used to the
full his first chance of leading his brigade in a general action. One
of the few scientific soldiers in the cavalry arm whom the British
army owned, Le Marchant had been mainly known as the founder and
administrator of the Royal Military College at High Wycombe, which was
already beginning to send to the front many young officers trained as
their predecessors had never been. He was the author of many military
pamphlets, and of a new system of sword exercise which had lately
been adopted for the cavalry<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559"
class="fnanchor">[559]</a>. On his promotion to the rank of
Major-General, in 1811, he had been unexpectedly sent to the Peninsula
in command of the heavy brigade, which reinforced Wellington during
that autumn. As an executive commander in the field he had given
the first proofs of his ability at the combat of Villagarcia<a
id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>—but
this was a small affair—at Salamanca he proved himself a born commander
of cavalry, and his services would have been invaluable to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[p. 453]</span> Wellington in later
fields but for the disastrous shot that ended his career. He was a man
of a lofty and religious spirit, ill to be spared by his country<a
id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>.</p>

<p>Le Marchant’s charge made a complete wreck of the left wing of the
French army. The remnants of the eight battalions which he had broken
fled eastward in a confused mass, towards the edge of the woods,
becoming blended with the separate stream of fugitives from Thomières’s
division. The 5th Division swept in some 1,500 prisoners from them, as
also the eagle of the 22nd Line, which the heavy brigade had broken in
their last effort, while five guns were taken by the 4th Dragoons<a
id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>.
The French, flying blindly from the pursuit, were so scattered that
some of them actually ran in headlong among D’Urban’s Portuguese
horse, on the back side of the plateau. ‘We were so far in their
rear,’ writes that officer, ‘that a mass of their routed infantry (to
our astonishment, since we did not know the cause) in the wildness
of their panic and confusion, and throwing away their arms, actually
ran against our horses, where many of them fell down exhausted, and
incapable of further movement.’ The same happened in the front of
the 3rd Division, where, according to a narrator in the Connaught
Rangers, ‘hundreds of men frightfully disfigured, black with dust,
worn out with fatigue, and covered with sabre-cuts and blood, threw
themselves among us for safety.’</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_454">[p. 454]</span></p> <p>The 3rd Division had now, in its
advance along the plateau, come in contact with the right flank of the
fifth, and both of them fell into one line reaching across the whole
breadth of the heights, while in front of them were recoiling the
wrecks of Thomières, Maucune, and Brennier. The four French regiments
which had not been caught in Le Marchant’s charge were still keeping
together, and making occasional attempts at a stand, but were always
outflanked on their left by the 3rd Division and Arentschildt’s and
D’Urban’s horse. Curto’s French light cavalry had rallied, and picked
up their second brigade, and were now doing their best to cover
the southern flank of the retreating multitude<a id="FNanchor_563"
href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>. An officer of one of
their regiments speaks in his memoirs of having charged with advantage
against red dragoons—these must apparently have been scattered parties
of Le Marchant’s brigade, pursuing far and furiously, since no other
red-coated cavalry was in this part of the field<a id="FNanchor_564"
href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>. But Curto’s squadrons
had mainly to do with Arentschildt and D’Urban, both of whom report
sharp fighting with French horse at this moment. The 3rd French Hussars
charged the 1st Hussars K.G.L., while the latter were employed in
gleaning prisoners from the routed infantry, and were only driven
off after a severe combat<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565"
class="fnanchor">[565]</a>. The pursuit then continued until the
disordered French masses were driven off the plateau, and on to the
wooded hills parallel with the Greater Arapile, where Marmont had
massed his army before his fatal move to the left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 4th Division and Pack’s Portuguese had fought,
with much less fortunate results, against the French divisions of
Clausel and Bonnet. There are good narratives<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_455">[p. 455]</span> of their advance from three officers
who took part in it, all so full and clear that it is impossible
to have any doubts about its details. One comes from the Assistant
Quarter-Master-General of the 4th Division, Charles Vere: the second
is from the captain commanding one of the four light companies of the
Fusilier brigade, Ludwig von Wachholz of the Brunswick-Oels Jägers:
the third is the narrative of Pack’s aide-de-camp, Charles Synge,
who was with the front line of the Portuguese in their vigorous but
unsuccessful attack on the Greater Arapile. The three narratives have
nothing contradictory in them.</p>

<p>The sequence of events was as follows. After deploying the three
battalions of the Fusilier brigade (1/7th, 1/23rd, 1/48th) beyond the
end of the village of Arapiles, and Stubbs’s Portuguese brigade to
their left, Cole started to cross the valley, having a very strong
skirmishing line, composed of the whole of the 7th Caçadores and of
the four light companies of the British brigade. During the first
stage of the advance, which started at 5.45<a id="FNanchor_566"
href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>, a perceptible time
after that of the 5th Division, the two brigades suffered severely
from French artillery fire, but had no infantry opposed to them.
Their objective was the division of Clausel, which had by this time
come into line on the extreme eastern end of the plateau occupied
by Maucune. When the advancing line had reached the trough of the
valley which separated it from the French heights, Cole saw that his
left front was faced by a detached French force<a id="FNanchor_567"
href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> on a low rocky ridge
half-way between the end of the plateau and the Great Arapile, and
also that behind the Arapile, and in a position to support this
detachment, were several other French battalions. Pack was deploying
to assault the Arapile, but even if he won a first success there was
visible a considerable mass of troops behind it. After the valley was
crossed Stubbs’s Portuguese brigade, coming first into action, with
the caçadores in front, attacked the French regiment on the knoll
and drove it back. It retired towards the Arapile and the bulk of
Bonnet’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[p. 456]</span> division,
to which it belonged. Cole detached his caçador battalion to follow
it, hoping that Pack might succeed in ‘containing’ the rest of the
French force in this direction. The remainder of his line pushed on,
with the light companies of the Fusilier brigade acting as its screen,
and attacked Clausel on the plateau. The advance was steady, but cost
many lives, and the line was enfiladed by a tiresome flank fire from
the French guns on the top of the Great Arapile. Nevertheless the
crest was reached—on it lay the front line of the French division—five
battalions—which engaged in a furious frontal combat of musketry with
the Fusiliers and their Portuguese comrades, but was beaten in it, and
fell back some 200 yards on to its reserves. The impetus of the attack
was exhausted, Cole had just been wounded, so that there was a gap
in the command, and the troops were re-forming and recovering their
breath, when it was seen that things were going very badly behind and
to the left. The attack on the Arapile had by this time been delivered,
and had failed completely.</p>

<p>Pack had grasped the fact that when the 4th Division had crossed
the valley, it would be much at the mercy of Bonnet’s troops in the
direction of the Arapile, which were now on its flank, and would
presently be almost in its rear. He therefore resolved to use the
option of attacking that Wellington had given him. He deployed the 4th
Caçadores as a skirmishing line, gave them as an immediate support
the four grenadier companies of his line regiments, and followed
with the rest in two columns, the 1st Line on the right, the 16th
on the left. The caçadores went up the comparatively level field
which formed the central slope between the two rocky ends of the
Arapile—it was sown with rye some three feet high that year. French
skirmishers in small numbers gave way before them, but the main
opposition of the enemy was from his battery placed on the summit.
The skirmishing line got four-fifths of the way to the crest, and
then found an obstacle before it, a bank of some four feet high,
where the field ended. It was perpendicular, and men scrambling up it
had to sling their muskets, or to lay them down, so as to be able to
use both hands. The caçadores were just tackling the bank—a few of
them were over it—when the French regiment on top, the 120th, which
had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[p. 457]</span> waiting
till the Portuguese should reach the obstacle, delivered a shattering
volley and charged. The caçadores were quite helpless, being more
engaged in climbing than in using their arms<a id="FNanchor_568"
href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>. They were swept off
in a moment, and the French, jumping down into the field, pursued them
vigorously, and overthrew first the supporting grenadier companies,
and then the two regiments, which were caught half-way up the slope.
As Napier truly observes, ‘the Portuguese were scoffed at for their
failure—but unjustly: no troops could have withstood that crash upon
such steep ground, and the propriety of attacking the hill at all seems
questionable.’ Pack made the attempt purely because he thought that it
was the only way of taking off the attention of the French from Cole’s
flank. The brigade suffered heavily, losing 386 men in ten minutes. It
took refuge at the foot of the British Arapile, where it was covered by
the 1/40th of Anson’s brigade, which was standing there in reserve.</p>

<p>The French brigadier in command on the Greater Arapile wisely
made little attempt to pursue Pack’s fugitives, but having his front
now clear of any danger, sallied out from behind his hill with three
regiments, the 118th and 119th and the re-formed 122nd, against the
flank and rear of the British 4th Division. There was nothing in front
of him save the 7th Caçadores, which Cole had detached as a covering
force, when he stormed the heights with the remainder of the brigades
of Ellis and Stubbs. This isolated battalion behaved very well, it
stood its ground in line, but was absolutely overwhelmed and broken
up by the superior numbers converging on it<a id="FNanchor_569"
href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>.</p>

<p>Nearly at the same moment Clausel’s whole force in column charged
the two brigades of the 4th Division which had carried the heights. The
French were in superior numbers—ten battalions to seven—and their two
reserve regiments were fresh troops, acting against men who had just
won a dearly-bought success by a great effort. The Anglo-Portuguese
line gave way, from the left first, where the 23rd Portuguese began
the movement. But it spread down the whole front, and the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[p. 458]</span> Fusiliers, no less
than Stubbs’s brigade, recoiled to the very foot of the plateau<a
id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>.</p>

<p>This reverse gave Clausel, who was now in command since Bonnet’s
wound, an opportunity that looked unlikely a few minutes before. He
could either withdraw the Army of Portugal in retreat, covering the
three disorganized divisions with those which were still intact—his
own, Bonnet’s, and the two reserve divisions of Ferey and Sarrut, which
had just come on the ground—Foy was far off and otherwise engaged—or
he might adopt a bolder policy, and attempt to take advantage of the
disaster to Pack and Cole, by bursting into the gap between Leith and
the British Arapile, and trying to break Wellington’s centre. Being an
ambitious and resolute man he chose the latter alternative—though it
was a dangerous one when Leith and Pakenham were bearing in hard upon
his routed left wing. Accordingly he left Sarrut to rally and cover the
three beaten divisions, and attacked with his right centre. His own
division followed the retreating brigades of Ellis and Stubbs down the
heights, while the three disposable regiments of Bonnet came into line
to its right, and Boyer’s three regiments of dragoons advanced down the
depression between the Greater Arapile and the recovered plateau. Ferey
was left in second line or reserve on the crest.</p>

<p>At first the advance had considerable success. Bonnet’s regiments
pushed forward on the right, driving in the 1/40th<a id="FNanchor_571"
href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>, which had come forward
to cover Pack’s routed battalions, and pressing quite close to the
British Arapile, whose battery was turned upon them with much effect.
Clausel’s own division pushed the Fusiliers some way down the slope
and right into the valley at its foot. The dragoons charged Stubbs’s
retreating Portuguese, and cut up many of them, though the 11th
regiment finally succeeded in forming square with what remained solid
of its companies, and beat off the main attack. Part of the French
horsemen, however, pushed on, and reached the front of Wellington’s
reserve line, the 6th Division, which had now descended the heights
to relieve the broken 4th. One battalion<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_459">[p. 459]</span> of Hulse’s brigade, the 2/53rd, was
charged by several squadrons, but formed square in time and repulsed
them. Some little way to the right the Fusiliers and the Portuguese
23rd formed a large parti-coloured square, expecting a similar attack,
but it did not come their way<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572"
class="fnanchor">[572]</a>.</p>

<p>Wellington, thanks to his own prescience, had ample reserves with
which to parry Clausel’s desperate stroke. Setting aside the Light
Division, which now paired off against Foy on the extreme left of the
field, there were the 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, not to speak of
Bradford’s Portuguese and España’s Spaniards, all of them perfectly
intact. And of these, such was his strength, only one fresh unit,
Clinton’s 6th Division, required to be brought up to turn the day. It
was now coming over the valley where the 4th had preceded it, in a long
majestic line, Hulse’s brigade on the right, Hinde’s on the left, the
Portuguese of the Conde de Rezende in second line. The 1st Division, if
it had been needed, could have supported Clinton, from its post just to
the north of the Lesser Arapile, but had not yet got under way.</p>

<p>The repulse of the new French attack was carried out with no
great difficulty, if not without serious fighting. The advance of
Clausel’s own division was checked by Marshal Beresford, who took
Spry’s Portuguese brigade out of the second line of the victorious 5th
Division, and led it diagonally along the southern slope of the plateau
to fall upon Clausel’s flank. This it did effectively, for the French
division could not dare to press on against the Fusiliers, and had to
throw back its left, and form up opposite Spry, with whom it became
engaged in a lively musketry fight. It could no longer move forward,
and was immobilized, though it held its own: Beresford was wounded in
the chest and taken to the rear, but Spry’s five battalions had served
the desired purpose, and stopped the French advance in this quarter.</p>

<p>But the decisive check to Clausel’s offensive was given by Clinton
and the 6th Division, who advancing straight before them—over the
ground previously traversed by Cole—fell upon,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_460">[p. 460]</span> overlapped at both ends, and thoroughly
discomfited in close musketry duel the nine battalions of Bonnet’s
division, which had pressed forward close to the Lesser Arapile, as
if to insert a wedge in the British line. Unsupported by Boyer’s
dragoons, who had shot their bolt too early, and were now re-forming
far to the rear, this French division was badly cut up. Each of the
three regiments which had taken part in its advance lost more than
500 men in the struggle<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573"
class="fnanchor">[573]</a>: they fell back in disorder towards the
hill behind them, and their rout compelled Clausel’s division to give
way also, since it exposed its flank to the oncoming line of Hulse’s
brigade on Clinton’s right. Moreover the Great Arapile had to be
evacuated, for while the routed troops passed away to its left rear,
the 1st British Division was soon after seen steadily advancing towards
its right. The regiment on the hill (the 120th) was exposed to be cut
off and surrounded, and hastily ran down the back of the mount: while
retreating it was much molested by the skirmishers of the German Legion
Brigade of the 1st Division. It lost heavily, and the battery that had
been on the summit was captured before it could get away.</p>

<p>Thus Clausel’s brief half-hour of triumph ended in complete
disaster, and the two divisions with which he had made his stroke
were flung back against the slope in front of the woods in their
rear, where they took refuge behind the intact division of Ferey, the
sole available reserve in this part of the field. They were now as
badly beaten as Thomières and Maucune had been earlier in the day<a
id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>.</p>

<p>While this lively action was in progress, the 5th and 3rd
Divisions, supported by the 7th and by Bradford’s Portuguese,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[p. 461]</span> in second line, and
assisted on their flanks by Arentschildt’s, D’Urban’s, and Anson’s
horse, had been driving in the wrecks of the French left wing towards
the woods. There was much resistance: on Sarrut’s intact battalions
many of the broken regiments had rallied. ‘These men, besmeared with
blood, dust, and clay, half naked, and some carrying only broken
weapons, fought with a fury not to be surpassed,’ says a 3rd Division
narrator of the battle. But the tide of battle was always moving
backward, towards the woods from which the French had originally
issued, and though it sometimes seemed about to stop for a minute or
two, a new outflanking manœuvre by the troops of Pakenham, D’Urban, and
Arentschildt, sufficed on each occasion to set it in motion again.</p>

<p>The last stage of the conflict had now been reached: the French
centre was as thoroughly beaten as their left had been earlier in
the day: many of the battalions had gone completely to pieces, and
were pouring into the woods and making their way to the rear, with
no thought except for their personal safety. Of intact troops there
were only two divisions left, Ferey’s in the centre, and Foy’s on the
extreme right near Calvarisa de Ariba. It was generally considered
that Foy ought to have been overwhelmed by the much superior British
force in front of him, for not only was he opposed by the Light
Division, whose skirmishers had been bickering with him all the
afternoon, but the 1st Division became available for use against
him the moment that it was clear that the French offensive against
the 4th Division had been shattered, by the advance of Clinton and
Spry. Wellington, it is said<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575"
class="fnanchor">[575]</a>, dispatched orders for the 1st Division to
move forward and strike in between Foy and the Greater Arapile, at the
moment that he saw that the 6th Division had broken Bonnet’s troops.
If so, the order was not executed, and General Campbell led out his
three brigades much too late, and not in time either to cut off Foy or
to encircle the right of the disordered mass of the enemy now retiring
into the woods. He seems to have acted simply as a link between
the 6th Division on his right, and the Light Division on his left,
for the latter alone pressed Foy vigorously.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_462">[p. 462]</span> The only part of Campbell’s division
which suffered any appreciable loss at this time of the day were the
light companies of Löwe’s brigade—that which was composed of the King’s
German Legion: they fell on the flank of the French regiment that
was evacuating the Greater Arapile, and did it considerable harm<a
id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the last and not the least bloody fighting of the day
was beginning, on the hillside just outside the head of the forest,
where Marmont had deployed his main body at midday, and where Ferey’s
division was now standing in reserve, while the broken troops both from
its front and from its flank were streaming by to the rear. Clausel
had given Ferey orders to cover the retreat at all costs, warning him
that unless he could hold back the advancing enemy for some time the
disaster would be complete. The general to whom this unenviable task
was assigned carried it out with splendid courage, and by his constancy
gave time for the escape of the whole of the confused mass behind him.
He drew out his nine battalions in a single line, the centre a little
advanced to suit the shape of the hillside, the flanks a little thrown
back. The extreme battalions at each end were in square, to guard
against possible attacks by cavalry, but the seven central units were
deployed <i>en bataille</i> in three-deep line, a formation which had not
been seen in the other episodes of the battle, and which made their
fire much more effective than that of regiments fighting in ‘column
of divisions,’ as most of their comrades had done<a id="FNanchor_577"
href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>.</p>

<p>Against the orderly front thus disposed Clinton came up with the
6th Division, pursuing his victorious advance. He was flanked on the
left by the Fusilier brigade of the 4th Division, which had long ago
rallied and come up to the front since its disaster of an hour back. On
Clinton’s right were the 5th and 3rd Divisions, but both were at the
moment re-forming, after their long struggle with Sarrut and the wrecks
of the French left wing. Anson’s cavalry had at last got to the front
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[p. 463]</span> this direction,
and replaced D’Urban and Arentschildt—whose squadrons were quite worn
out—upon the extreme right of the allied line.</p>

<p>Clinton, it is said<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578"
class="fnanchor">[578]</a>, refused to wait till the troops on his
right were re-formed, and hurried on the attack: it was growing dark,
and a few more minutes of delay would allow the French to make off
under cover of the night. Therefore he advanced at once, and found
himself engaged at once in a most desperate musketry contest, whose
deadly results recalled Albuera, so heavy were the losses on both
sides. But here the French had the advantage of being deployed, and not
(as at Albuera) wedged in deep columns. The first fire of the French
line, as Clinton’s brigades closed in, was particularly murderous,
and swept away whole sections of the attacking force. ‘The ground
over which we had to pass,’ writes an officer in Hinde’s brigade<a
id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>,
‘was a remarkably clear slope, like the glacis of a fortress, most
favourable for the defensive fire of the enemy, and disadvantageous
for the assailant. The craggy ridge, on which the French were drawn
up, rose so abruptly that the rear ranks could fire over the heads of
the front. But we had approached within two hundred yards before the
musketry began: it was far the heaviest fire that I have ever seen, and
accompanied by constant discharges of grape. An uninterrupted blaze was
thus maintained, so that the crest of the hill seemed one long streak
of flame. Our men came down to the charging position, and commenced
firing from that level, at the same time keeping touch to the right,
so that the gaps opened by the enemy’s fire were instantly filled up.
At the first volley about eighty men of our right wing fell to the
rear in one group. Our commanding officer rode up to know the cause,
and found that they were every one wounded!’ But heavy as was the loss
of this regiment (137 out of 600 present), it was trifling compared
to that of its neighbours to the right, in Hulse’s brigade, where the
right and centre regiments in the line, the 1/11th and 1/61st, lost
respectively 340 men out of 516 and 366 out of 546—a proportion to
which only Albuera could show a parallel. For<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_464">[p. 464]</span> many minutes—one observer calls it nearly
an hour, but the stress of the struggle multiplied time—the two hostile
lines continued blazing at each other in the growing dusk. ‘The glare
of light caused by the artillery, the continued fire of musketry, and
by the dry grass which had caught fire, gave the face of the hill a
terrific appearance: it was one sheet of flame, and Clinton’s men
seemed to be attacking a burning mountain, whose crater was defended
by a barrier of shining steel<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580"
class="fnanchor">[580]</a>.’ The French, so far as losses went,
probably suffered no more, or perhaps less, than their assailants: but
their casualties were nevertheless appalling. And at last they gave
way: ‘the cruel fire cost us many lives,’ writes an officer of the
31st Léger, ‘and at last, slowly, and after having given nearly an
hour’s respite to the remainder of the army, Ferey gave back, still
protected by his flanking squares, to the very edge of the forest,
where he halted our half-destroyed division. Formed in line it still
presented a respectable front, and halted, despite of the English
batteries, which enfiladed us with a thundering fire. Here Ferey met
the form of death which the soldier prefers to all others, he was slain
outright by a round-shot<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581"
class="fnanchor">[581]</a>.’</p>

<p>Clinton’s English regiments were so disordered and reduced by the
awful fire through which they had passed in their victorious march,
that he put into front line for a final assault on the enemy his
Portuguese brigade, that of the Conde de Rezende, which was still
intact, as it had hitherto been in reserve. Its five battalions
deployed, and advanced against the now much contracted line of Ferey’s
division: they were supported on the left by the Fusilier brigade of
the 4th Division, on the right by the 5th Division, which was now
re-formed and well to the front. Anson’s cavalry was also in this
direction.</p>

<p>The dying effort of Ferey’s division was worthy of its previous
hard fighting. ‘Formed right up against the trees,’ writes the French
officer, whom we have already quoted, ‘no longer with any artillery to
help, we saw the enemy marching up against us<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_465">[p. 465]</span> in two lines, the first of which was
composed of Portuguese. Our position was critical, but we waited for
the shock: the two lines moved up toward us; their order was so regular
that in the Portuguese regiment in front of us we could see the company
intervals, and note the officers behind keeping the men in accurate
line, by blows with the flat of their swords or their canes. We fired
first, the moment that they got within range: and the volleys which
we delivered from our two first ranks were so heavy and so continuous
that, though they tried to give us back fire for fire, the whole
melted away. The second line was coming up behind—this was English,
we should have tried to receive it in the same way, still holding our
ground though under a flank fire of artillery, when suddenly the left
of our line ceased firing and fell back into the wood in complete
disorder. The 70th Ligne had found itself turned by cavalry; it broke;
the rout spread down the front to the 26th and 77th; only our two
battalions of the 31st Léger held firm, under the fire of the enemy,
which continued so long as we showed outside the edge of the forest.
We only gave back as the day ended, retiring some 250 yards from our
original position, and keeping our <i>voltigeur</i> companies still in a
skirmishing line in front<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582"
class="fnanchor">[582]</a>.’</p>

<p>This vigorous account of the last stand of the French reserve is
not far from being accurate. It is quite true that the Portuguese
brigade of the 6th Division suffered terribly in its attack, and was
completely checked. It lost 487 men during the fifteen minutes in
which it was engaged—the heaviest casualty list in any of the brigades
of its nation, even heavier than that of Stubbs’s troops in the 4th
Division. The only point that requires to be added is that it was not
so much a panic caused by a partial cavalry charge which broke the 70th
Ligne, and finally dispersed Ferey’s regiments<a id="FNanchor_583"
href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>, as the pressure of
the 5th Division upon the whole of the left of their line, which
collapsed almost simultaneously. But they had done their work—before
they dispersed, leaving only the 31st Léger to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_466">[p. 466]</span> act as a most inadequate rearguard,
they had detained the allies for a half-hour or more, and night had
set in. Wellington ordered the 6th Division to pursue, but it was so
much cut up and fatigued that it only advanced a hundred yards into
the forest, and then halted and settled down for the night. Why the
intact 7th Division was not rather used for the pursuit it is hard
to understand. Still more so is the fact that no cavalry was sent
forward in this direction: the woods, no doubt, looked uninviting and
dangerous, but the enemy was in a state of absolute panic, and ready to
disperse at the least pressure. ‘But,’ says the most intelligent of the
British diarists with the mounted arm, ‘the cavalry during the assault
on the last hill was ordered back to the point on the left where we
assembled before the attack, leaving the infantry to pursue without
us. Had this not been done (though it might not have been prudent to
pursue with both in the night), yet by their being at hand there was a
greater chance of accomplishing more. The order came from Sir Stapleton
Cotton himself. The infantry moved in pursuit by moonlight.... I have
heard from an officer in the 6th Division that although they had
been marching all day, and were so tired, when ordered to halt for
the night, that they could not possibly have marched much farther,
yet they sat up through the night, talking over the action, each
recalling to his comrade the events that happened<a id="FNanchor_584"
href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>.’</p>

<p>Some part of the slackness of the pursuit is to be explained by an
unfortunate misconception by which Wellington (through no fault of
his own) was obsessed that night. He was under the impression that
the Castle of Alba de Tormes was still held by the Spanish garrison
which he had left there, and that the bridge and the neighbouring
ford were therefore unavailable for the retreat of the French, who
(as he supposed) must be retiring by the fords of Huerta and Villa
Gonzalo, which they had used to reach the field. Unhappily—as has been
already mentioned—Carlos de España had withdrawn the battalion at Alba
without making any mention of the fact to his Commander-in-Chief<a
id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>.
Wellington therefore put more thought to urging the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[p. 467]</span> pursuit in the direction
of the East than of the South, and it was not till late in the night,
and when nothing but stragglers had been picked up on the Huerta road,
that he discovered what had really occurred.</p>

<p>It remains to relate the unimportant happenings on this front during
the evening. At the moment when the French attack on Wellington’s
centre failed, about 7 o’clock or soon after, Clausel sent to Foy,
whose division still lay behind Calvarisa de Ariba, covering the way to
the Huerta fords, the order to retire. His instructions were to cover
the flank of the line of retreat of the broken army, and to take up
successive detaining positions on its right, on the eastern side of the
brook and ravine which lie between the two Arapiles and the village
of Utrera. These orders Foy carried out skilfully and well. He fended
off the Light Division, which had moved out in pursuit of him, with
a heavy rearguard of light troops, always giving way when pressed.
His concern was almost entirely with this British unit, for the 1st
Division had started too late to get near him. The Light Division and
its battery kept him on the run, but never came up with his main body.
‘Night alone saved my division, and the troops that I was covering,’
wrote Foy, ‘without it I should probably have been crushed, and the
enemy would have arrived at Alba de Tormes before the wrecks of our
seven routed divisions got there. An hour after dark the English
cavalry was still pushing charges home against my regiments, which I
had placed in alternate chequers of line and column. I had the luck to
keep the division in hand till the last, and to steer it in the right
direction, though many routed battalions kept pressing in upon my left,
and threatened to carry disorder into my ranks. The pursuit ceased
near Santa Maria de Utrera<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586"
class="fnanchor">[586]</a>.’</p>

<p>It is difficult to make out what became of the heavy dragoons of
Bock during this long retrograde movement of Foy’s division: they
were certainly not the cavalry of which the French general speaks
as charging him during his retreat, for they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_468">[p. 468]</span> returned no single man or horse
killed or wounded that day<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587"
class="fnanchor">[587]</a>. Perhaps, far away to the left, they may
have been driving in from position to position, the one regiment of
Boyer’s dragoons which had been left to cover Foy’s extreme outer
flank. More probably they may have been pushing their march towards
the fords of Huerta, in the vain hope of finding masses of disbanded
enemies on the way, and ultimately cutting them off from the river.
This hypothesis is borne out by the fact that the bivouac of the heavy
German brigade was that night in front of Pelabravo, much to the
north-east of the resting-places of the rest of the army, and in the
general direction of the fords<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588"
class="fnanchor">[588]</a>.</p>

<p>That the pursuit was misdirected was a most lamentable chance for
Wellington. If it had been urged in the right direction, the Army of
Portugal would have been annihilated as a fighting-body, and would
never have been able to make head again in the autumn. For the forest
of Alba de Tormes was full of nothing but a disorderly crowd, making
the best of its way towards the bridge, with no proper rearguard and
no commander in charge of the retreat. Clausel, wounded in the foot,
was being looked after by the surgeons in Alba, and was barely able
to mount his horse next day. The rout was complete: ‘a shapeless
mass of soldiery was rolling down the road like a torrent—infantry,
cavalry, artillery, wagons, carts, baggage-mules, the reserve park of
the artillery drawn by oxen, were all mixed up. The men, shouting,
swearing, running, were out of all order, each one looking after
himself alone—a complete stampede. The panic was inexplicable to one
who, coming from the extreme rear, knew that there was no pursuit by
the enemy to justify the terror shown. I had to stand off far from the
road, for if I had got near it, I should have been swept off by the
torrent in spite of myself<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589"
class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.’ So writes the officer, already
twice quoted for the narrative of the end of the battle, whose
regiment, still hanging together in the most<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_469">[p. 469]</span> creditable fashion, brought up the rear
of the retreat. It is clear that any sort of a pursuit would have
produced such a general block at the bridge-head that a disaster like
that of Leipzig must have followed, and the whole of the rear of the
Army of Portugal, brought up against the river Tormes, must have
surrendered <i>en masse</i>.</p>

<p>From eight o’clock at night till three in the morning the routed
army was streaming across the bridge and the ford. Once covered by the
Tormes some regiments regained a certain order, but many thousands of
fugitives, pressing on ahead in unthinking panic, were scattered all
over the country-side, and did not come back to their colours for many
days, or even weeks.</p>

<p>The actual loss of the Army of Portugal would appear to have
been some 14,000 to 15,000 men, not including the ‘missing,’ who
afterwards turned up and came back to the ranks. Marmont in his
dispatch had the effrontery to write that he lost only 6,000 men<a
id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>, and
9 guns: a statement only equalled in mendacity by Soult’s assertion
that Albuera had cost him but 2,800 casualties<a id="FNanchor_591"
href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. No general list of
losses by regiments was ever given to Napoleon, though he demanded it:
but a return proposing to include the casualties not only of Salamanca
but of the minor combats of Castrillo and Garcia Hernandez was drawn
up, giving a total of 12,435<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592"
class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. On the whole, however, it would be safe
to allow for 14,000 men as the total loss, exclusive of stragglers.
Among officers of rank the Commander-in-Chief was wounded: Ferey and
Thomières were killed: the latter died inside the English lines after
the battle. Clausel and Bonnet were both wounded, the former slightly,
the latter severely, so that four of the eight divisional generals of
infantry were hit. Of the brigadiers, Desgraviers (division Thomières)
was mortally and Menne (division Foy) severely wounded. The trophies
lost were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[p. 470]</span> 2 eagles
(those of the 22nd and 101st), 6 other colours<a id="FNanchor_593"
href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>, and 20 guns<a
id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>. Of
these last 12 represented the divisional batteries of Thomières and
Bonnet, which were taken whole, and the other 8, as it would seem,
pieces captured from the long line of batteries on Maucune’s flank,
which was rolled up when Le Marchant and Leith swept the plateau in
their triumphant advance. Of the eight French divisions those of
Thomières and Bonnet would appear to have lost about 2,200 men apiece,
Maucune nearly 2,000, Clausel, Brennier, and Ferey above 1,200 each,
Sarrut perhaps 500: Foy’s very heavy losses nearly all fell on the
next day. The cavalry, with 43 officers hit, must account for at
least 500 more of the total<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595"
class="fnanchor">[595]</a>, and the artillery must have lost, along
with their 20 guns, at least 300 or 400 gunners<a id="FNanchor_596"
href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>. Of prisoners
(wounded and unwounded), there were according to Wellington’s
dispatch 137 officers<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597"
class="fnanchor">[597]</a> and nearly 7,000 men.</p>

<p>Wellington returned his loss in the British units as 3,129, in the
Portuguese as 2,078: of España’s Spaniards 2 were killed and 4 wounded.
This makes up the total of 5,173, sent off immediately after the
battle. The separate Portuguese return forwarded by Beresford to Lisbon
gives the loss of the troops of that nation as somewhat less—1,637
instead of 2,078: the difference of 441 is partly to be accounted
for by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[p. 471]</span>
reappearance of stragglers who were entered as ‘missing’ in the first
casualty-sheet, but cannot entirely explain itself in that fashion.
Which of the returns is the more accurate it is hard to be sure, but a
prima facie preference would naturally be given to the later and more
carefully detailed document. Taking British and Portuguese together,
it is clear that the 6th Division, which lost 1,500 men, was far the
hardest hit. The 3rd and 5th, which decided the day on the right,
got off easily, with a little more than 500 each: the 4th Division,
owing to the mishap to the Fusilier brigade and Stubbs’s Portuguese,
had very nearly 1,000 casualties. Pack’s five battalions lost 386 men
in the one short episode of the battle in which they were engaged,
the unsuccessful attack on the Great Arapile, and were lucky to fare
no worse. The cavalry total of 173 killed and wounded was also very
moderate considering the good work that the brigades of Le Marchant,
D’Urban, and Arentschildt performed. In the 1st, 7th, and Light
Divisions, the trifling losses were all in the flank-companies sent out
in skirmishing line: of the battalions none was engaged as a whole<a
id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>.
The artillery were overmatched by the French guns all through the
day, and it is surprising to find that they returned only four men
killed, and ten wounded. The casualty list of officers of high rank was
disproportionately large—not only was Le Marchant killed, but Marshal
Beresford, Stapleton Cotton, commanding the cavalry<a id="FNanchor_599"
href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>, and Leith and Cole,
each a divisional general, were disabled. Of officers in the Portuguese
service, Collins, commanding a brigade of the 7th Division, was
mortally hurt, and the Conde de Rezende, who led the Portuguese of the
6th Division, was wounded.</p>

<p>The victory of Salamanca was certainly an astonishing feat of rapid
decision and instantaneous action. The epigrammatic description of it
as ‘the beating of 40,000 men in forty minutes’ hardly over-states its
triumphant celerity: before that time had elapsed, from the moment when
Pakenham and Leith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[p. 472]</span>
struck the French left, the battle was undoubtedly in such a condition
that the enemy had no chance left—he could only settle whether his
retreat should be more or less prompt. Clausel chose to make a hopeless
counter-offensive move, and so prolonged the fight till dark—he would
probably have been wiser to break off at once, and to retreat at six
o’clock, covering his routed left with his intact reserve divisions. He
would certainly have lost several thousand men less if he had retired
after repulsing Cole and Pack, and had made no attempt to press the
advantage that he had gained over them. It may be argued in his defence
that the last hour of battle, costly though it proved to him, prevented
Wellington’s pursuit from commencing in the daylight, an undoubted
boon to the defeated army. But at the most the victor would have had
only one hour at his disposition before dusk; the French were taking
refuge in a forest, where orderly pursuit would have been difficult;
and looking at Wellington’s usual methods of utilizing a victory (e.
g. Vittoria) we may feel doubtful whether the beaten enemy—if covered
by Sarrut, Ferey, and Foy, as a regular rearguard, would have suffered
more than he actually did. For Wellington’s whole idea of pursuit
turned on the false notion that the castle, bridge, and ford of Alba
de Tormes were still blocked by the Spaniards whom he had left there.
By the time that he had discovered that the enemy was not retreating
towards Huerta and Villa Gonzalo, but escaping over the Tormes in some
other way, the hour would have been late.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the best summary and encomium of Wellington’s tactics
on this eventful day is that of an honest enemy, the very capable and
clear-sighted Foy, who wrote in his diary six days after the fight<a
id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>:</p>

<p>‘The battle of Salamanca is the most masterly in its management,
the most considerable in the number of troops engaged, and the most
important in results of all the victories that the English have gained
in these latter days. It raises Lord Wellington almost to the level
of Marlborough. Hitherto we had been aware of his prudence, his eye
for choosing a position, and his skill in utilizing it. At Salamanca
he has shown himself a great and able master of manœuvres. He kept
his dispo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[p. 473]</span>sitions
concealed for almost the whole day: he waited till we were committed
to our movement before he developed his own: he played a safe game<a
id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>: he
fought in the oblique order—it was a battle in the style of Frederic
the Great. As for ourselves, we had no definite intention of bringing
on a battle, so that we found ourselves let in for it without any
preliminary arrangements having been made. The army was moving without
much impulse or supervision, and what little there was stopped with the
wounding of the Marshal.’ In another note he adds: ‘The Duke of Ragusa
committed us to the action—he brought it on contrary to Clausel’s
advice. The left was already checked when he received his wound: after
that moment it was impossible either to refuse to fight, or to give the
fight a good direction: all that could be done was to attenuate the sum
of the disaster—that Clausel did. There was no gap in the command—we
should have been no better off if the Marshal had never been hurt. He
is not quite honest on that point in his dispatch<a id="FNanchor_602"
href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>.’</p>

<p>With this criticism we may undoubtedly agree. Foy has hit upon
the main points in which Salamanca was a startling revelation to the
contemporary observer—no one on the French side, and but few upon the
British, had yet realized that Wellington on the offensive could be
no less formidable and efficient than Wellington on the defensive.
After July 22, 1812, no opponent could dare to take liberties with
him, as Soult, Masséna, and Marmont, each in his turn, had done up
till that date. The possible penalty was now seen to be too great.
Moreover, the prestige of the British general was so much enhanced
that he could safely count upon it as not the least of his military
assets—as we shall see him do in the Pyrenees, a little more than a
year after Salamanca had been won. To the other thesis that Foy lays
down—the statement that Marmont had, by his initial movement, made
disaster inevitable before he was wounded—we may also give our assent.
Jourdan came to the same conclusion—the Emperor Napoleon also fixed
the responsibility in the same way. The Marshal’s ingenious special
pleading, to the effect that but for his personal misadventure<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[p. 474]</span> he would yet have won the
day, will convince none but blind enemies of Wellington. Of some of the
charges which Napoleon laid to his charge he must be acquitted: he did
not know in the least that King Joseph was on his way to join him from
Madrid with 15,000 men. The dispatches sent to warn him of this fact
had all miscarried, and the last news from the Army of the Centre which
had reached him had intimated that no immediate help was to be expected
from that quarter. Nor was he wrong in not waiting for the succours
from Caffarelli: these were so trifling—800 sabres and one horse
battery—that their presence or absence could make little difference in
the battle.</p>

<p>But the Marshal’s flagrant and irreparable fault was that,
having made up his mind that Wellington would not fight under any
provocation—a conclusion for which the earlier episodes of the campaign
gave him some justification—he got his army into a position in which he
had battle suddenly forced upon him, at a moment when he was not in a
position to accept it with advantage. The attempt to turn Wellington’s
right wing on the afternoon of July 22nd was an unpardonable liberty,
only taken because the Marshal had come to despise his opponent. The
liberty was resented in the most forcible way—and there was no means of
avoiding disaster when Thomières and Maucune had once started out on
their rash turning movement.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER VIII">SECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER VIII</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE CONSEQUENCES OF SALAMANCA</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dawn of July 23rd revealed to
Wellington that the French army had passed the Tormes at the bridge
and forts of Alba, and that nothing remained on the western bank of
the river save small parties of fugitives and wounded, who had lost
their way in the forest. Some of these were gleaned up by Anson’s and
Bock’s brigades of cavalry, who were pushed forward to search the woods
and seek for the enemy. Anson’s patrols reached the bridge, and found
a French rearguard watching it. This was composed of Foy’s division,
to whom Clausel had committed the covering of his retreat. It cleared
off, after firing a few shots. Foy had been told to block the passage
till 9 o’clock, but went off long before, when the disordered main
body had got a good start. On the report that he was gone, Wellington
sent Anson’s squadrons across the bridge of Alba de Tormes, while Bock
forded the river lower down at La Encina. The state of the roads,
strewn with baggage and wounded men, showed that the French had
used all the three roads leading east from Alba<a id="FNanchor_603"
href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>, and were on their way
to Arevalo, not towards their base at Valladolid: to have marched in
that direction would have brought them right across the front of the
advancing British army. Wellington sent out detachments on all the
roads which the enemy had taken, but urged the main pursuit by the
central and most important road, that by Garcia Hernandez on Peñaranda.
Contrary to his wont, he pushed on this day with great celerity, riding
himself with the head of the column formed by the main body of Anson’s
light dragoons. This vanguard was followed, at some distance, by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[p. 476]</span> 1st and Light
Divisions. Those infantry units which had fought hard on the previous
day were allowed a rest. About seven miles beyond Alba de Tormes
Anson’s patrols came upon a regular rearguard of the enemy, behind the
Caballero brook (a tributary of the Almar), in and about the village of
Garcia Hernandez. This was, of course, Foy and the French 1st Division,
the only troops in Clausel’s army which had not been seriously engaged
in the battle. They were accompanied by a battery and a brigade of
Curto’s <i>chasseurs</i>. Around and about the formed troops scattered
parties were visible—the village was full of men drawing water from
the wells. On the approach of the British cavalry column—the infantry
were still miles behind—Foy prepared to resume his retreat, the cavalry
drew up on a rising ground, to the north of Garcia Hernandez, to cover
the movement: the leading regiments of the foot started off at once
along the high-road, the others halted for a space, to the right of
the <i>chasseurs</i>, out of sight of the British, whose view of them was
intercepted by the slope on which the French cavalry were drawn up.</p>

<p>Wellington, as it seems, saw only the hostile squadrons, and
resolved to drive them off without delay, in order to be able to press
in upon the infantry columns which were retiring farther away. He
directed Anson to attack the <i>chasseurs</i> with so much of his brigade
as was up at the front: several squadrons were absent, some guarding
the prisoners of yesterday, others exploring on distant roads. Two
squadrons each of the 11th and 16th Light Dragoons delivered the
frontal attack on the French brigade, while the leading squadrons of
Bock’s brigade, which was coming up rapidly from the flank, and was not
yet formed in line, were to turn its right wing.</p>

<p>The French light cavalry, which had been much mauled on the
preceding day, and was evidently in no fighting mood, gave way
precipitately before the attack of the Light Dragoons, and rode off
in confusion to their own right rear. There was no time for Bock’s
Germans to come up with them: but the leading squadrons of the 1st
Heavy Dragoons of the Legion, pushing on in pursuit, received, to their
surprise, a heavy volley in their flank from a French battalion in
square, which they had not noticed in their advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[p. 477]</span>There were, in
fact, two regiments of infantry to the right of the routed <i>chasseurs</i>,
and by the sudden flight of their comrades they found themselves
suddenly uncovered and engaged. They were the 6th Léger and 76th
Line, each two battalions strong, and counting together about 2,400
bayonets. Of these the unit nearest the cavalry was a battalion of
the 76th in square: it was the fire of this body which had struck the
leading German squadron in flank, and thrown it into disorder as it was
charging the routed French horse. Farther to the east were the other
battalion of the 76th and the two of the 6th Léger, on the slopes above
the road, which here winds below the small eminence which the French
cavalry had occupied and the hill of La Serna, a long and fairly steep
height, which gives its name in many histories to the combat that
ensued.</p>

<p>What followed on the unexpected discovery of the French infantry
was the effect not of Wellington’s direct orders, nor of the leading
of the short-sighted Bock, who had hardly realized the situation when
his subordinates were already making their decision. It was entirely
the exploit of the gallant squadron-leaders of the two regiments of
German dragoons. They were coming up in a sort of échelon of squadrons,
the first regiment leading, so that when the fire of the French square
struck and disordered the leading unit, the responsibility for action
fell on the officers commanding the others. Captain von der Decken
who led the 3rd squadron determined without hesitation to charge the
French square—his men were already getting up speed, and the enemy
was but a short distance from him. Shouting to the squadron to throw
forward its right wing and ride home, he led it straight at the French.
The first fire of the square, delivered at eighty yards, brought down
several men and horses, and wounded (mortally as it proved in the end)
von der Decken himself. He kept his saddle, however, and only fell
when the second fire was given, at twenty yards range. This volley
was destructive, but did not break the impetus of the squadron, which
charged right home. In most cases where cavalry reached the bayonets
of a square during the Peninsular War, it had proved unable to break
in, and had recoiled with loss—like Craufurd’s squadrons at the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[p. 478]</span> combat of Barquilla<a
id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>,
and Montbrun’s at Fuentes de Oñoro. Here, however, the rare feat of
riding down well-formed infantry was performed—it is said by several
eye-witnesses that the breach was originally made by a mortally-wounded
horse, which reared right on top of the kneeling front rank of the
French, and then rolled over kicking, and bore down six or eight men
at once. Several dragoons leapt the bank of struggling and overthrown
soldiers, and broke into the rear ranks—thereupon the whole square fell
to pieces in disorder. Many of the Frenchmen were hewn down, but the
majority dropped their muskets and surrendered unhurt. The lists of
prisoners at the Record Office give the names of sixteen officers of
the 76th sent to England, of whom only two were wounded. Of the rank
and file not more than fifty, it is said, got away<a id="FNanchor_605"
href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>. Observers who came
on the field later in the day noted with curiosity the long lines of
muskets laid down in orderly rows. This was an astonishing achievement
for a single squadron of 120 men—they had captured or cut down five
times their own numbers of veteran troops of Ney’s old 6th Corps.</p>

<p>Some way to the right of this unlucky battalion were two more,
forming the 6th Léger. Seeing the havoc made of his comrades, and
noting the remaining squadrons of the Germans sweeping across the
slope toward him, the colonel of this regiment ordered his men to
retreat uphill and climb the steep slope behind. He hoped to get upon
ground where cavalry could not easily follow. The two battalions,
still in column, for they had not (like the 76th) formed square,
moved hastily upwards: the voices of officers were heard shouting,
’<i>allongez le pas, gagnons la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[p.
479]</span> hauteur</i><a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606"
class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.’ The nearest enemy to them was the second
squadron of the 1st Dragoons K.G.L., led by Captain von Reizenstein,
who put on the pace when he saw the French scrambling higher, and came
up with the rearmost battalion before it was very far from the road.
The two rear companies faced about when the dragoons drew near, and
delivered a fire that was fairly effective, when it is considered that
the men had been going as hard as they could trot, and were halted and
put into action at a second’s notice. But it did not suffice to stop
the dragoons, who rode in, at the cost of many killed and wounded, and
cut up the companies that had stood to meet them: many men were sabred,
more taken prisoners. The rear of the column, however, scrambled uphill
in a mass, and there joined the other battalion of the 6th Léger, which
formed square on the sky-line. They had on their flank a squadron or so
of <i>chasseurs</i>, apparently a fragment of the brigade that had given way
so easily before Anson’s attack twenty minutes before.</p>

<p>Against this mass charged the leading squadrons of the 2nd Heavy
Dragoons K.G.L., which had at last come up to the front, and some
of the officers and men of the 1st, who had already done such good
work lower down the hill. The French square was not perfect or
regular—apparently it was disordered by the fugitives from the broken
battalion, who ran in for shelter, and formed up as best they could.
The charge of the Germans was delivered with splendid impetus—though
the regiment had been galloping for 300 yards uphill—and was completely
successful. The French <i>chasseurs</i> rode off without engaging: the
ill-formed square crumpled up: many of the men threw down their arms
and surrendered, the rest dispersed and ran in coveys along the slopes
of the plateau, towards the nearest friendly troops. These were the
four battalions of the 39th and 69th Line, the surviving regiments of
the division. Foy himself was in one of the squares; his surviving
brigadier, Chemineau, in the other.</p>

<p>Intoxicated with the glorious successes that they had gained,
a large but disordered mass of the victorious dragoons rode after
the fugitives, and charged the nearest of the French squares—one
of the 69th Line. The enemy held firm, their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_480">[p. 480]</span> fire was given with effect, and killed
the officer who led this last effort (Captain von Uslar) and many of
his men. The rest swerved back, and rode away under a pelting fire from
the battalion that they had attacked and from the other three, which
lay close on its flank.</p>

<p>So ended the charge of Garcia Hernandez, the most dashing and
successful attack made by any of Wellington’s cavalry during the whole
war, as Foy—the best of witnesses—formally states in his history<a
id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>.
Though not more destructive in its results than Le Marchant’s onslaught
on Maucune at Salamanca, it was a far more difficult affair. For Le
Marchant had charged troops not in square, and already shaken by
conflict with Leith’s division; while the Germans attacked without
any infantry support, and fell upon intact battalions, of which two
at least had formed square. Moreover, the French were supported by
artillery and cavalry, though the former cleared off promptly, and
the latter allowed themselves to be routed very easily by Anson’s
squadrons. Altogether it was a glorious first experience of war
for the Heavy Dragoons—neither of the regiments had ever charged
before, and they had seen but a little skirmishing during the six
months since their arrival at Lisbon. They were duly granted the
battle-honour, ‘Garcia Hernandez,’ which they continued to bear
on their guidons as long as Hanover was an independent state. Two
Hanoverian cavalry regiments of to-day in the Prussian army continue
to show it, as theoretical heirs of the old Heavy Dragoons. The most
astonishing feature of the exploit was that it was the sole work of
the squadron-leaders—Wellington had only given the general order to
attack—Bock had been with the fraction of the 1st Dragoons which
charged along with Anson, and was not directing the marvellous uphill
ride. It was a regimental triumph, not an exhibition of cavalry
tactics by the Commander-in-Chief or the brigadier<a id="FNanchor_608"

    SALAMANCA<br /> Combat of GARCIA HERNANDEZ (July 23 1812)
  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">The losses of the victors were very heavy—the 1st
Regiment had 2 officers and 28 men killed, 2 other officers wounded
(one—von der Decken—mortally), and 37 men. The 2nd Regiment lost 1
officer (von Uslar) killed, with 21 men, and 1 officer and 29 men
wounded. In this total the striking figure is the high proportion
of killed to wounded—52 to 69—which bears witness to the murderous
power of the old musket-ball when delivered point-blank, into the
bodies of men who were pressing right up to the muzzles of the
infantry in square. There were six men missing to be added to the
total of losses—127 in all—whether these were individuals who were
taken prisoners in the last attempt to break the square of the 69th,
or whether they were mortally wounded men, whose horses carried them
far from the scene of action and whose bodies were not found, it is
impossible to say. The loss of 127 officers and men out of about 770
present was, however, by no means disproportionately heavy, when the
results of the charge are considered.</p>

<p>Of the two French regiments engaged, a whole battalion of the 76th
was captured or destroyed—of the 27 officers with it one was killed,
5 wounded, 16 taken prisoners: taking the same proportion of its rank
and file, very few out of 650 can have escaped. The 6th Léger was less
completely annihilated, but it had its colonel (Molard) and 6 other
officers taken prisoners<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609"
class="fnanchor">[609]</a>, and 8 more wounded, with about 500 rank and
file taken or hurt. Allowing for some small losses to the <i>chasseurs</i>,
the total casualties of the French must have been about 1,100.</p>

<p>When the last charge of the Heavy Dragoons was over, Foy led his
surviving battalions off, followed at a distance by Anson’s brigade,
when it had re-formed. The Germans were too fatigued to do more: the
leading British infantry, the Light Division, was only just coming in
sight far to the rear. The pursuit, therefore, by the four British
squadrons had no further results—if they had chanced to have a horse
battery with them it might have been much more effective. Six miles
from Garcia Hernandez, Foy was relieved to find, waiting for him by
the roadside, the long-expected cavalry brigade from the Army of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[p. 482]</span> the North—Chauvel’s 1st
Hussars and 31st Chasseurs: these fresh squadrons took up the rearguard
duty for the rest of the day, and covered the march of the infantry to
Peñaranda.</p>

<p>From this day onward Wellington’s pursuit cannot be said to have
been urged with any great vigour. On the morning of the 24th the
vanguard entered Peñaranda, to find that the French had started off
before dawn. G. Anson’s brigade followed, accompanied this time by
Bull’s and Ross’s horse artillery, which had come up from the rear.
The tail of the enemy’s column was found at Aldea Seca, a few miles
beyond Peñaranda: he started off without firing a shot, and was out of
sight before more than two guns had been brought to shell him. It seems
that opportunities were lost this day—an intelligent observer remarks
that ‘if only the whole brigade and twelve guns had come up, we might
have taken 500 of them—great part of the infantry were without arms<a
id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>.’</p>

<p>That night the British head-quarters and vanguard were at Flores
de Avila, but the enemy were quite out of sight. ‘How they get on
their troops at such a rate I cannot conceive,’ wrote Wellington,
‘but they left this about two in the morning, and they will arrive
in Valladolid to-morrow<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611"
class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.’ He gave up all attempt at close or rapid
pursuit on the 25th, reporting to Lord Bathurst, ‘I find the troops so
much fatigued by the battle and their previous and subsequent marches,
and the enemy have got so far before our infantry, that I halted this
day, and have sent on only the light cavalry and guerrillas.’ After
this there was no prospect of doing any further harm to Clausel, or
of scattering his demoralized army before it had time to recover
its cohesion. ‘This does not look like the quick advance following
up a great victory,’ wrote a critical dragoon<a id="FNanchor_612"
href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>, ‘and I think they will
be let off too easily. The peasants report them as in a dreadful state:
all their cavalry, except a few for their rearguard, is employed in
carrying their sick.’ It may be taken for certain that a general of the
Napoleonic school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[p. 483]</span>
would have urged on his cavalry at all costs—there was plenty of
it, and none save Le Marchant’s and Bock’s brigades had suffered
any serious loss. Nor can it be doubted that such a hunt would have
been richly rewarded by captures. Clausel wrote on the 25th that he
could only rally 22,000 men<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613"
class="fnanchor">[613]</a>; and as some 48,000 had fought at Salamanca,
and the actual losses seem to have been about 14,000, it is clear
that he must be allowing for over 12,000 stragglers and unarmed
fugitives—whom an active pursuit might have swept up.</p>

<p>Wellington’s defence for the slowness of his movement would
undoubtedly have been that a headlong chase might have cost him
over-much—he would have lost too many men, and—what was even more
important—too many horses by forcing the pace. Clausel’s army had been
put out of action for some weeks by the battle of Salamanca—to smash
it up still further would give him no such profit as would justify
the expenditure of several thousands of his precious British troops.
He was looking forward to the possibility of having to fight Soult
and Suchet—not to speak of King Joseph—and wished to be as strong as
possible for the present. It is probable that he made a mistake in
holding back—Clausel, being left practically unmolested, was able
to rally his army somewhat sooner than his adversary calculated. By
August it was again able to give trouble: in October its strength was
sufficient to wreck the Burgos campaign. If it had been well hunted
in the last days of July, it would seem that no such reorganization
would have been possible—only negligible fragments of it should have
reached Valladolid or Burgos. Yet it must always be remembered that
economy of men was the cardinal necessity for Wellington—his total
British force was so small, the difficulty of getting up drafts and
reinforcements was so enormous, the total number of the enemy’s armies
in the Peninsula was so overpowering, that he could not afford to
thin down his regiments by the exhausting forced marches that were
necessary in an active pursuit. It would have been little profit to
him if he had exterminated the Army of Portugal, only to find himself
left victorious, indeed, but with a force so weak and so tired out that
further exertion was impossible. As it was, many<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_484">[p. 484]</span> of his battalions in August showed
only 300 bayonets in line<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614"
class="fnanchor">[614]</a>, and only recovered their strength, by the
reappearance of Badajoz and Salamanca convalescents, and the arrival of
drafts, during the following winter.</p>

<p>It was at Flores de Avila on July 25th that Wellington received the
news that a new factor had come into the game. King Joseph had left
Madrid four days earlier with the Army of the Centre, and was marching
northward by the Guadarrama Pass and Villa Castin, with the obvious
intention of joining Marmont. This move would have been all-important
if it had taken place ten days earlier: but when the Army of Portugal
was in absolute rout, and flying by forced marches towards the Douro,
the appearance of the King was too late to be dangerous. He could not
strengthen the beaten army sufficiently to enable it to fight—and he
would expose himself to some peril if he continued his forward march,
and came any nearer to the British line of advance.</p>

<p>Joseph’s long hesitation and tardy start require a word
of explanation. It will be remembered<a id="FNanchor_615"
href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> that his last
communication which had got through to Marmont was a dispatch dated
June 30, in which he had expressed his surprise that the Army of
Portugal was refusing battle, and stated that he could offer no
immediate help. If Hill, from Estremadura, should march to join
Wellington, he had directed that D’Erlon should move up in a similar
fashion northward, and he himself would come also, with all or part
of the Army of the Centre. But supposing that Hill should remain in
the far south, beyond the Guadiana, Joseph gave no promise of coming
to Marmont’s aid. Indeed he never mentioned this contingency at all,
except to say that if Wellington had not been joined by his lieutenant,
‘you should choose a good position and give battle with all your troops
united.’</p>

<p>Since writing this epistle Joseph had experienced many searchings
of heart. On the very day on which it was sent off he had received a
dispatch from Soult, which filled him with dismay: the Duke of Dalmatia
said that he had forbidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[p.
485]</span> D’Erlon to cross to the north bank of the Tagus, even if
it were certain that Hill and his corps had gone to join Wellington.
Writing in high wrath, the King, on July 2nd, threatened to remove
Soult from his command in Andalusia. ‘If you have formally forbidden
D’Erlon to pass the Tagus, in case the English force in Estremadura
goes off to join the enemy’s main body, you have given him orders
contradictory to those which I sent both to him and to you. You
set your authority above mine, you refuse to recognize me as
Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of Spain. Consequently, placed as I
may be between the two alternatives—of either depriving myself of the
service of your talent and military experience, or of allowing the
powers confided to me by the Emperor to be broken in my hand almost
as soon as given—I can have no hesitation.... Painful as it is to me,
therefore, I accept the offer which you formerly made me, to resign
your command if I do not revoke my original order; for not only do I
refuse to revoke it, but I hereby repeat it again both to you and to
Comte d’Erlon. If you prefer to take this extreme step of disobedience,
resign your command to D’Erlon, as your senior general of division, and
he will take it up till the Emperor shall nominate your successor<a
id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>.’</p>

<p>This angry dispatch was followed by another, written on July 6th,
which varied the original order to Soult in an important feature. For
instead of speaking of a northern movement of D’Erlon’s troops as
consequent on a similar transference of Hill’s corps to Castile, it
makes no mention of Hill, but prescribes a definite manœuvre without
any reference to the action of that British general. ‘Send at once to
Toledo a force of 10,000 men: 8,000 infantry, 2,000 horse, with the men
and horses for 12 guns. By leaving the guns behind, the march of the
corps will be made more rapid, and the roads are good.... I authorize
you to evacuate any part of the occupied territory that you may choose,
in order to hasten the departure of these 10,000 men, whose arrival I
await with great impatience<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617"
class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.’</p>

<p>Clearly it would take many days for these orders to get to
Soult, who was at this time before Cadiz. As a matter of fact<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[p. 486]</span> they only reached his
hands on July 16th, and long before that date Joseph was becoming
very anxious at the state of affairs on the Douro. He got news that
Caffarelli, scared by Home Popham’s diversion, had sent no succours to
Marmont, and he received letters from Suchet, which showed him that he
could not count on any reinforcement from Valencia<a id="FNanchor_618"
href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>. It was certain that,
even if Soult yielded to the peremptory orders sent on July 2 and July
6, the detachment under D’Erlon could not reach Toledo till somewhere
about the 1st August. That it would start at all seemed doubtful,
in face of a letter of July 3 from D’Erlon, stating that he was
being ‘contained’ by no less than 30,000 men under Hill—a scandalous
perversion of fact, for Hill had not over two-thirds of that force<a
id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>.</p>

<p>The days were running on, Marmont was still unsuccoured: it
seemed likely that neither from the North, from Valencia, nor from
Andalusia, would any help come to hand. The King grew more and more
anxious—all the more so because he had ceased to receive reports
from Marmont, since the line of communication with him had been
cut by the guerrilleros. Finally, on July 9th<a id="FNanchor_620"
href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>, he made up his mind
that, since no other help could be got for the Army of Portugal,
he would march himself with the Army of the Centre, even though to
concentrate it he must evacuate all New Castile and La Mancha, and
even imperil the safety of Madrid. On that day he issued orders to
Treillard to evacuate the valley of the Tagus—all the Talavera and
Almaraz region—and to the Rheinbund Germans to abandon La Mancha.
All the small posts in the direction of the eastern mountains were
also drawn in, even those watching the passes of the Somosierra
and the Guadarrama. Only in Toledo, Guadalajara, and Segovia, were
small garrisons left behind. By the morning of the 19th July<a
id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> the
most distant detachments had all come in, and the Army of the Centre
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[p. 487]</span> concentrated
at Madrid, about 14,000 strong, and able to spare 10,000 for the field
when the capital had been garrisoned. But the King resolved to wait
two days longer before marching, because he had just received news of
the approach of an unexpected but most welcome reinforcement. Early
in the month he had heard that Palombini’s Italian division of the
Army of Aragon was hunting the Empecinado and Mina in the direction of
Calatayud and Tudela. He had sent out a Spanish emissary with a letter
to Palombini, bidding him to draw in towards Madrid, if he had not
already marched to join Marmont, who had hoped to get his assistance.
It does not seem that the King had built much upon the results of this
letter: orders sent to Suchet’s troops had generally been disregarded.
But it chanced to reach the Italian general at Alfaro on the Ebro
on July 12th, and Palombini, having no opportunity of referring the
responsibility to his immediate commander, who was 200 miles away
at Valencia, resolved to obey. He marched for Soria and Siguenza,
brushing off guerrillero bands that strove to molest him, and sent
to Joseph the news that he might be expected at Madrid on the 21st.
These tidings came to hand on the 18th, and filled the King with such
high satisfaction that he resolved to wait for the Italian division.
It arrived on the appointed day, having made a most creditable
forced march of 150 miles by mountain roads, through a burnt-up and
desolate country. Without leaving it even one night’s rest at Madrid,
the King started it off in company with his own troops, which had
been awaiting all day the signal for departure<a id="FNanchor_622"
href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>.</p>

<p>Joseph’s expeditionary force, thus increased to 14,000 men,
consisted of his Guards, horse and foot, one French brigade (28th and
75th Ligne), D’Armagnac’s Germans (five battalions and one cavalry
regiment), Treillard’s strong division of dragoons, and part of
Hugo’s division of Spanish <i>Juramentados</i>, together with Palombini’s
detachment, which amounted to six battalions and a regiment of
dragoons. The garrisons of Madrid, Toledo, Segovia, and Guadalajara
were made up partly of <i>Juramentados</i>, and partly of the large body
of drafts for the Army of Andalusia, which had accumulated at Madrid
since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[p. 488]</span> the posts
in the Sierra Morena had been given up in April. The King had been in
no hurry to send them on to Soult, and now found them very useful.
The command of the garrison was left to General Lafon Blaniac, who
was acting as governor of Madrid and Captain-General of New Castile.
A few days after Joseph’s departure a welcome addition turned up, in
the shape of Suchet’s garrison of Cuenca, under General Maupoint,
consisting of two battalions of the 16th regiment and a squadron of
<i>chasseurs</i>. On getting the King’s order to evacuate Cuenca, this
officer (like Palombini) had obeyed it, and, instead of retiring on
Valencia, had come on to Madrid, with his 1,000 men and three millions
of reals, representing the provincial treasury<a id="FNanchor_623"
href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>.</p>

<p>Having once collected his army, the King marched with great
speed, passed the defiles of the Guadarrama on the 22nd, and reached
Espinar, the great junction of roads in the province of Avila,
next day. The cavalry that night were at Villa Castin, eight miles
farther to the front, on the road to Arevalo and Valladolid. Here
the news came to hand, not from any authorized source but from the
rumours of the country-side, that Marmont had crossed the Douro on
the 17th, and was closely engaged with Wellington somewhere in the
direction of Salamanca. On receiving this information Joseph and
Jourdan resolved not to continue their march towards Valladolid,
but to swerve westward, with the intention of joining the Duke of
Ragusa on the Tormes. Turning off from the main road, the cavalry
reached Villanueva de Gomez on the night of the 24th; the King and
the infantry got to Blasco Sancho. Orders were issued for the whole
army to march on Peñaranda next morning. But during the hours of
darkness rumours of the battle of Salamanca and its results came
to hand, and on the following morning they were confirmed by the
arrival of two Spanish emissaries, one bearing a letter from the
wounded Marmont, the other a second from Clausel. The Marshal’s
letter was insincere and inconclusive—after giving a long account of
the battle, which threw all the blame on Maucune, he said that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[p. 489]</span> he had lost 5,000
men, the enemy infinitely more (!), and that the army was falling
back to take a position behind the Eresma river<a id="FNanchor_624"
href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>, or perhaps behind the
Douro. Clausel’s epistle was a far more honest document; it said that
he was in a state of incapacity to resist Wellington, that he could
not put even 20,000 men in line for some days, that he must retreat as
fast as possible on Valladolid, to pick up his dépôts and magazines,
which he must send off without delay, and that he would then fall
back on the Army of the North. He distinctly told the King that, even
if the Army of the Centre joined him, they would be unable to resist
Wellington for a moment. He recommended Joseph to call up succours
from Soult and Suchet: if Wellington and the English main body marched
on Madrid the Army of Portugal would remain on the Douro, but only in
that case. If pursued by Wellington he must retire towards Burgos. He
evidently regarded any junction between his troops and the King’s as
impracticable and useless<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625"
class="fnanchor">[625]</a>.</p>

<p>Confronted by this new and unpromising situation, Joseph and
Jourdan had to choose between two policies—they might retire towards
Madrid and cover the capital, in the hope that Soult might conceivably
have carried out the orders given him on July 6th, and have sent
a detachment toward Toledo and Madrid. Or they might, despite of
Clausel’s advice and warning, move northward towards the Douro and try
to get into communication with the Army of Portugal. If the direct road
by Arevalo to Valladolid was too dangerous, there remained another and
more circuitous route by Cuellar, which Wellington was too far off to
reach.</p>

<p>The King and Jourdan chose the first alternative without a
moment’s hesitation<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626"
class="fnanchor">[626]</a>: if they joined the Army of Portugal, they
had Clausel’s assurance that they could effect nothing. They would be
driven back on Burgos; Madrid would be exposed to a raid by any small
detachment that Wellington might send against it, and touch with Soult
and Suchet would be lost. The King, therefore, marched back by the way
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[p. 490]</span> he had come,
and had reached on the 26th the Venta de San Rafael, at the foot of the
Guadarrama pass. He had got so rapidly out of Wellington’s way that
their armies did not touch—save indeed that a patrol of Arentschildt’s
brigade surprised and captured near Arevalo 2 officers and 25 men of
the King’s light cavalry<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627"
class="fnanchor">[627]</a>—Juramentado <i>chasseurs</i>.</p>

<p>When informed that the Army of the Centre had fallen back in haste
toward Madrid, Wellington resolved that his duty was to continue
pushing Clausel northward, and away from the King. The latter might
be disregarded; his strength was known, and it was almost certain
that he would not be reinforced. For Hill had just sent in a report,
which had come through in four days, that Drouet was showing no signs
of moving toward Toledo; and he enclosed an intercepted dispatch
of Soult’s, which proved that the latter had no intention whatever
of carrying out the King’s oft-repeated orders<a id="FNanchor_628"
href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>. Accordingly the
British head-quarters were moved on to Arevalo on the 27th of July, and
to Olmedo on the 28th. Anson’s and Arentschildt’s light cavalry went on
in front: they reported that the enemy was still in a complete state of
disorganization. He was burning the villages as he went, and leaving
many stragglers dead in the cornfields beside the road, for the wounded
were sinking by the way, and any marauders who went far from the main
column were being killed by the peasantry and the guerrilleros<a
id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.</p>

<p>Clausel crossed the Douro by the two bridges of Tudela and Puente
de Douro on the 27th-28th, leaving only some light troops to the south
of the river, and entered Valladolid, where he set to work at once to
evacuate all the more valuable stores, and so many of the sick and
wounded as could find transport, along the high-road to Palencia and
Burgos. The Anglo-Portuguese infantry was already approaching Medina
del Campo and Olmedo, while Santocildes, with the section of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[p. 491]</span> Army of Galicia which
was not employed on the siege of Astorga, was ordered to march past
Toro and Tordesillas to threaten Valladolid from the north bank of the
Douro, and Silveira was directed to resume the blockade of Zamora with
his militia-division.</p>

<p>On the 29th the Light and 1st Divisions, Wellington’s infantry
vanguard, drove in the screen of light troops which Clausel had left
in front of the Douro: the French retired and blew up the bridges. But
this was of little avail, for the British cavalry forded the river at
Boecillo and continued their advance. Thereupon the enemy evacuated
the city of Valladolid, and withdrew along the direct road to Burgos,
save one division (Foy’s), which retreated excentrically, up the north
bank of the river toward Aranda. In Valladolid were found 17 guns,
800 sick and wounded, whose condition had rendered it impossible for
them to travel, and a large magazine filled with artillery material,
besides other stores. The people received Wellington with every mark
of enthusiasm, though they had the reputation of including a greater
proportion of <i>Afrancesados</i> than any other city of northern Spain<a
id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>.
They treated him to illuminations, a ball, and copious harangues of
congratulation. Meanwhile Anson’s brigade swept the country to the
east and north, and reported no enemy visible; while the guerrillero
Marquinez entered Palencia, and captured 300 stragglers from Clausel’s
rearguard. The French had gone back beyond the Arlanza river, and
were lying at Lerma, Torquemada, and Santa Maria del Campo, ready to
retreat to Burgos itself if any further pressure was applied. It was
not forthcoming—much to Clausel’s surprise—and he halted and began to
reorganize his shattered army. What survived of his train and stores,
his sick, and the <i>cadres</i> of several skeleton battalions were sent
back to Burgos. The rest stood still, awaiting further developments.</p>

<p>Wellington, meanwhile, had brought none of his infantry north of the
Douro, though all were now near at hand, and the Light Division had
repaired the bridge of Tudela. He had resolved to turn his attention to
King Joseph and Madrid. Only Santocildes and his two Galician divisions
were ordered up to Valladolid (where they arrived on August 6th) to
support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[p. 492]</span> Anson’s
cavalry, who took up cantonments at various villages in front and to
the flank of the city.</p>

<p>The movements of the King and his army on July 27th-31st had been
somewhat puzzling to the British general. On arriving at the foot of
the Guadarrama pass, they had halted, and then (instead of pursuing
the straight road to Madrid) had swerved off to Segovia, which lies
on the northern slope of the mountains, as if they had abandoned
their original intention of leaving the Army of Portugal to its own
devices. This flank march was the result of the receipt of letters
borne by Marmont’s aide-de-camp, Fabvier, which said that Clausel was
no longer being pursued with energy, and that it was possible that
he might stop on the Adaja and cover Valladolid<a id="FNanchor_631"
href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>. It was a momentary
inspiration, with no reality behind it, for Clausel was in full retreat
again before the King reached Segovia. But misled by its fallacious
cheerfulness, Joseph had made a move which rendered it possible for
him to join the Army of Portugal, if it had really halted. He was soon
undeceived, and after remaining three days at Segovia in some peril,
for Wellington had now turned against him, he evacuated that high-lying
city on August 1st, and made his final retreat on Madrid by the
Guadarrama pass.</p>

<p>Just after he had left Segovia<a id="FNanchor_632"
href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> King Joseph received a
dispatch from Soult, dated July 16. It was a reply to the peremptory
orders sent him on July 6th, which had directed him to evacuate part of
Andalusia and to send a large detachment to Toledo. This was a strange
document, which amounted to an absolute refusal to obey instructions.
After stating (quite falsely) that Hill was advancing with 30,000 men
in Estremadura, and that in consequence he was himself about to repair
thither, he announced that the evacuation of Andalusia would be ruinous
to the French cause in Spain. ‘We could not find means to subsist
either on the Tagus or in Estremadura, and from one position to another
we should retreat as far as the Ebro. There is a way to avoid this;
by taking the initiative we can save 6,000 sick and maimed men whom
I should probably have to abandon, as well as 200,000 Spaniards (who
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[p. 493]</span> declared for
your Majesty, and will be lost without hope), also 2,000 guns, and the
only artillery arsenal now existing in Spain. A single order by your
Majesty can effect this, and shorten the Spanish war by six campaigns.
Let your Majesty come to Andalusia in person, with every man that can
be collected: if the number is large we can increase the expeditionary
force in Estremadura to 25,000 or 30,000 men, and transfer the seat of
war to the left bank of the Tagus. The Army of Portugal, being relieved
of pressure, will be able to come into line again. Whatever occurs,
your Majesty will find yourself at the head of a splendid army, ready
to deliver battle. If the worst came, and we were unlucky, there is
always the resource of retiring on the Army of Aragon [in Valencia] and
so keeping the field.... I have the honour to repeat to your Majesty
that I cannot send any detachments beyond the Sierra Morena or the
Guadiana, save by evacuating all Andalusia and marching with my whole
army. I must have a positive order from your Majesty to that effect<a
id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>.’</p>

<p>This was an astonishing letter for a Commander-in-Chief to receive
from a subordinate. Instead of obeying a very definite order to move
a certain number of troops to a certain point, Soult replies by
sending to the King an alternative plan of campaign. And this plan,
it is not too much to say, was an absolutely perverse and insane one.
It must be remembered that, when Soult was writing, the battle of
Salamanca was still six days in the future, and the Army of Portugal
was known to be at close quarters with Wellington and in urgent need
of reinforcements. Soult urges his master to abandon Marmont to the
enemy, to evacuate Madrid, to give up his communication with France,
and to retire into Andalusia, where he would be cut off from all the
other imperial armies, for it was not possible even to communicate with
Suchet and Valencia, since the Spanish Army of Murcia blocked the way.
The cardinal sin of this project was that if the French were to hold
Spain at all, it was necessary for them to be strong in the North:
Soult proposed to deliver over the North to Wellington, by leaving
Marmont in the lurch. As Napoleon had observed, five months earlier, ‘a
check to the Army of Portugal would be a calamity<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_494">[p. 494]</span> which would make itself felt all over
Spain. A check to the Army of the South might force it back on Madrid
or Valencia, but would be of a very different degree of importance<a
id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>.’ He
had said much the same thing four years before, when first his armies
were invading Spain; for he then expressed the opinion that a disaster
to Bessières in Castile would be the one ruinous possibility: defeats
in the South or East mattered comparatively little. Soult, blinded
by his own interest in the viceroyalty of Andalusia, refused to see
this obvious fact. Long after he had received the news of Salamanca,
he persisted in maintaining that the true policy was to hold on to
Seville, even when the British army was at Madrid, and the wrecks of
Marmont’s forces were retiring on Burgos. Of this we shall hear more
presently.</p>

<p>King Joseph on receiving Soult’s letter returned answer: ‘You
will see by my letter of the 29th July the errors that you have
been labouring under as to Lord Wellington’s real designs. Hasten,
therefore, to carry out the orders which I give you—viz. to evacuate
Andalusia and march with your whole army on Toledo<a id="FNanchor_635"
href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>.’ Even so the King
did not obtain exact obedience to his commands, but received a second
series of counter-projects: and in the end Soult marched not on Toledo
but on Valencia, and only many days after he had been instructed to
commence his movement.</p>

<p>Wellington was, of course, unaware of the exact motives which
had induced King Joseph to make his flank march to Segovia, but he
considered that it might mean that there was some intention on the part
of Clausel to bring the Army of Portugal to join the Army of the Centre
by way of the Upper Douro [i. e. via Aranda]. He therefore resolved
to make such a conjunction impossible, by driving the King over the
mountains and towards Madrid<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636"
class="fnanchor">[636]</a>.</p>

<p>While Anson’s and Arentschildt’s cavalry continued the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[p. 495]</span> pursuit of Clausel on
the 29th-30th, and the 1st and Light Divisions were brought up to
the neighbourhood of Tudela, opposite Valladolid, the rest of the
army was turned against King Joseph. It was necessary to find out, as
a preliminary, whether he was really making a stand at Segovia. To
ascertain this point D’Urban’s Portuguese horse pushed out from Olmedo
on the 29th, and found the King’s cavalry in Santa Maria de Nieva,
ten miles in front of Segovia. Deserters from the Spanish Guards here
came in to D’Urban, and gave him useful information as to the exact
strength of the Army of the Centre. On the 30th Wellington placed at
D’Urban’s disposal the German Heavy Dragoons, a battalion of Halkett’s
brigade of the 7th Division, and a British battery, telling him to
drive in the enemy’s screen. The French gave way reluctantly, and on
hearing of their attitude Wellington ordered the whole 7th Division to
follow D’Urban’s detachment, and other divisions to make ready to move
in succession. But the report that Segovia was being firmly held, as
the <i>point de rassemblement</i><a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637"
class="fnanchor">[637]</a> for Clausel, turned out to be false, for
when the flying column approached that city it learnt that the main
body of the enemy had left it in the morning for the Guadarrama pass.
A considerable rearguard, under General Espert<a id="FNanchor_638"
href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>, however, was left
to guard Segovia till the King should have got a fair start; and its
mediaeval walls made it defensible for a short time against a force
without heavy artillery. D’Urban could do nothing with his cavalry, but
sent to Wellington a request that the 7th Division might move round to
intercept Espert’s retreat towards the Guadarrama by a forced march.
His chief replied that he had no great faith in the success of any of
these attempts to ‘cut the French off,’ and that it did not appear to
him more practicable at Segovia than elsewhere. ‘The result of such
attempts would merely be to fatigue the troops in getting into Segovia,
and it might as well be done without fatiguing them.’ And so it was,
for Espert decamped by night on August 3 unmolested, and D’Urban
entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[p. 496]</span> place
next morning, followed some time later by the infantry. He at once
explored the mountain road toward the pass, and found that the French
had completely disappeared: not even at the ‘Puerto’ of the Guadarrama
was a vedette to be seen.</p>

<p>Wellington had now to revise his whole plan of campaign, since it
had become clear that the two armies opposed to him had retreated in
different directions, and could not possibly combine. While it was
still conceivable that Clausel might defend the line of the Douro, he
had brought up the main body of his infantry to Olmedo. But after his
entry into Valladolid on the 30th, and the precipitate retreat of the
Army of Portugal toward Burgos, he had been for two days under the
impression that King Joseph might stand at Segovia. Not only had he
sent on the German dragoons and the 7th Division to follow D’Urban, but
on July 31st he moved his own head-quarters and the 3rd Division to
Cuellar, while the 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions were at El Pino on the
Cega river, a few miles behind. He wrote next morning (August 1st) that
he was in such a position that Joseph and Clausel could not possibly
join, and that if the King lingered any longer at Segovia, ‘I can move
upon him, and make him go quicker than he will like<a id="FNanchor_639"
href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.’ But he imagined that
the Army of the Centre would fall back instantly on Madrid—as indeed it
was doing at the very moment that he was writing his dispatch.</p>

<p>On receiving the information that Joseph had vanished, Wellington
halted for three whole days [August 2nd, 3rd, 4th] with his
head-quarters at Cuellar, and his infantry gathered round him in its
neighbourhood. The 1st and Light Divisions, which had marched as far
as the Douro, came southward to join the rest. But it was only on
the 5th that orders were issued for the march of nearly the whole
army on Segovia, by the road to Mozencillo. During these three days
of halt Wellington had made up his mind as to his general policy.
Clausel, whose army was harmless for the present, was to be ignored:
only a small containing force was to be left in front of him,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[p. 497]</span> while the main body of
the Anglo-Portuguese host marched on Madrid.</p>

<p>The strategical purpose that determined this decision was never
set forth in full by Wellington. His contemporary dispatches to Lord
Bathurst and to Hill are short, and lack explanatory detail—he states
his decision, but says little of his reasons for making it. Nor did he,
at the end of the campaign, write any long official narrative of his
doings, as he had done in 1810 and 1811. The causes that governed his
action have to be deduced from scattered opinions expressed in many
different documents. We need hardly take seriously the common French
dictum, found in many a book written by his exasperated opponents,
that he ‘wished to parade himself as conqueror and liberator in the
Spanish capital.’ That was not the sort of motive which any serious
student of Wellington’s character would dream of imputing to him. Nor,
if we translate it into less offensive terms, would it be true to say
that it was the political advantage of expelling the King from Madrid,
and so demonstrating to all Europe the weakness of the French hold
on the Peninsula, that was the determining cause of the march into
New Castile and the abandonment of the campaign on the Douro. We must
rather look for definite military reasons. And of these the predominant
one was that he conceived that the most probable result of the battle
of Salamanca would be to force the King to call up Soult and Suchet to
Madrid, in order to check the Anglo-Portuguese army, even at the cost
of abandoning great tracts of conquered land in Andalusia and Valencia.
Such indeed, as we have already seen, was Joseph’s purpose. The order
to Soult to evacuate his viceroyalty and to march on Toledo with his
whole army had been issued a day or two before Wellington had made up
his mind to turn southward. Suchet had been directed at the same time
to send all that he could spare toward Madrid. Though the pursuit of
Clausel to the Ebro offered many advantages, it would be a ruinous move
if the enemy should concentrate 70,000 men at Madrid, and then march
on Valladolid, to take the allied army in the rear and cut it off from
Portugal.</p>

<p>It was quite uncertain whether Soult or Suchet would make this move.
But that it was the correct one is certain.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_498">[p. 498]</span> Wellington was aware that Soult had
been summoned to send troops northward. Hitherto he had found excuses
for refusing to obey, as his last intercepted dispatch of July 8th
sufficiently showed. But the results of Salamanca might probably render
further disobedience impossible: and the moment that Soult should
hear of that tremendous event, it was reasonable to suppose that he
would abandon his viceroyalty, and march to join the King with every
available man. If he found Joseph and his army still in possession of
Madrid, they would have a central base and magazines from which to
operate, and a very favourable strategic position. It was true that
Wellington could call up Hill’s 18,000 men, but this was the only
succour on which he could count: neither Ballasteros nor the numerous
garrison of Cadiz would ever appear in New Castile, if old experience
was to be trusted. If some Spaniards did arrive, they would be very
uncertain aid. Granted, therefore, that Soult marched on Toledo and
Madrid to join the King, Wellington must take almost every man of the
Salamanca army to face them, even allowing for the certain junction of
Hill. He could only afford to leave a small ‘containing force’ to look
after Clausel.</p>

<p>But there was another possibility which made the situation still
more doubtful. Would Suchet also push up to join King Joseph with the
Army of Valencia, or the greater part of it? If he should do so, the
odds would be too great, and a defensive campaign to cover Portugal,
and so much as was possible of the newly regained Spanish provinces,
would be the only resource. But Suchet’s action depended upon a factor
over which Wellington had some influence, though not a complete and
dominating control. When he had started on the Salamanca campaign he
had been relying on Lord William Bentinck’s Sicilian expedition to
keep the French in Valencia engaged: an attack on Catalonia would draw
Suchet northward with all his reserves, and nothing would be left
which O’Donnell and the Spanish army of Murcia could not ‘contain.’ It
will be remembered that a few days before the battle of Salamanca<a
id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
Wellington had received the disheartening news that Bentinck had
countermanded his expedition, and was turning himself to some
chimerical scheme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[p. 499]</span>
for invading Italy. This had left Suchet’s attention free for the
moment, and he might conceivably have sent troops to join the Army of
the Centre. Fortunately he had not done so—only Palombini’s division
and the small garrison of Cuenca had been swept up by King Joseph,
without the Marshal’s consent and much to his disgust.</p>

<p>Now, however, the whole prospect in eastern Spain had
been transformed by the cheering news, received on July 30th
near Valladolid<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641"
class="fnanchor">[641]</a>, that Bentinck had once more changed his
mind, and that a considerable expeditionary force under General
Maitland had been sent to Majorca, to pick up the Spaniards of
Whittingham and Roche, and to execute, after all, the projected
diversion. Maitland’s own dispatch arrived four days later; it had
travelled with extraordinary celerity from Palma to Cuellar in
fifteen days, and announced his arrival on the Spanish coast and his
intention to operate at once. This being so, Suchet would be ‘out of
the game’ if all went well, and only the King and Soult need be taken
into consideration for the next month. But it was all-important that
the diversion on the East Coast should be executed with firmness and
decision.</p>

<p>The best summary of Wellington’s views at this moment is to be
found in his letter to Lord William Bentinck<a id="FNanchor_642"
href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>, explaining the
importance of Maitland’s action in August.</p>

<p>‘I have lately, on the 22nd, beaten Marshal Marmont in a general
action near Salamanca, and I have pursued him beyond the Douro and
entered Valladolid. The King is at Segovia with 12,000 or 15,000
men, and, having driven Marmont from the lower Douro, my next object
is to prevent him and Marmont (if possible) from joining: this I am
about to attempt. Either the French [i. e. King Joseph] must lose all
communication with their troops in the north of Spain, or they must
oblige me to withdraw towards the frontiers of Portugal. This they
cannot effect without bringing against me either Suchet’s army, or
Soult’s army, or both. I cannot but think, therefore, that it is very
important that the attention of Suchet should be diverted from his
possible operations against me by the Sicilian army, which will go
to such important objects as Tarragona and Valencia.... If Suchet’s
attention cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[p. 500]</span>
diverted from me, and (notwithstanding Marmont’s defeat) the French
become too strong for me, I shall at least have the satisfaction of
reflecting, while I am retiring, that General Maitland’s progress will
be unopposed, and we shall take Tarragona and Valencia.’</p>

<p>A few days later Wellington was pleased to find that Suchet had
been duly scared. An intercepted dispatch from him to King Joseph
showed that he was thinking of nothing but the appearance of an English
fleet off the Valencian coast, and that it was most unlikely that
he would send any serious succours to the King<a id="FNanchor_643"
href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>. There remained
therefore only Soult to be considered. The natural thing for him to do
would be to evacuate Andalusia: as Wellington wrote a fortnight later,
‘any other but a modern French army would now leave that province<a
id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>.’
Hill was writing at the same time, ‘Lord Wellington continues
advancing, and if he is able to keep his forward position, Soult
will be ordered to reinforce the King. Indeed I think that he <i>must</i>
quit this part of the country entirely, if matters do not go better
with them’ [the French]<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645"
class="fnanchor">[645]</a>.</p>

<p>What neither Wellington nor Hill could foresee, in early August,
was that the Marshal would still hang on to Andalusia, and renew, in a
more pressing form, his proposal of July 16th that Joseph and the Army
of the Centre should take refuge with him beyond the Sierra Morena.
But whether King Joseph received, or did not receive, succours from
the South or East, it was clearly good military policy to turn him out
of Madrid, while the Army of Portugal was still completely negligible
as a factor in the game. The loss of Madrid would be ruinous to him
if he was left without reinforcements: if he received them, the enemy
would find the problem of subsistence much more difficult if he had
not Madrid to rely upon as his central base and magazine. Toledo would
not serve him half so well. And the political effects of the recovery
of the Spanish capital, even if only for a time, must be well worth
gaining. It would shake the confidence of the <i>Afrancesado</i> party all
over the Peninsula, and it would be noted all round Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[p. 501]</span>Accordingly
Wellington resolved to leave only a small containing detachment on the
Douro, to look after Clausel, whose recuperative power he somewhat
underrated, and to march on Madrid with a force that would enable him,
if joined by Hill, to fight Soult and King Joseph in combination.
The containing body was put in charge of Clinton, who was almost the
only divisional general of the old stock who still remained with the
army. Graham and Picton were invalided, Leith and Lowry Cole had been
wounded at Salamanca, along with Beresford and Stapleton Cotton. Nearly
all the divisions were under interim commanders. Another reason for
choosing Clinton for the detached duty was that his division, the
6th, had suffered more than any other unit at the recent battle. It
was very low in numbers, only 3,700 men, including its Portuguese
brigade, and needed to pick up convalescents and drafts before it
could be considered effective for field service. Along with the 6th
Division there were left the five battalions<a id="FNanchor_646"
href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> that had recently
joined the army from England or the Mediterranean stations: they were
all Walcheren regiments, and still riddled with sickness; and all had
suffered from the forced marches which had brought them to the front
just before. Wellington was discontented with their condition. ‘The
truth is, neither officers nor soldiers are accustomed to march. The
men are very irregular, and owing to their irregularities not able to
bear the labour of marching in the heat of the sun<a id="FNanchor_647"
href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>.’ They were left to
strengthen Clinton, and to acclimatize themselves to the Spanish
summer: if taken on to Madrid they would have sown the roadside with
broken-down stragglers.</p>

<p>The five newly-arrived battalions brought Clinton’s strength up
to 7,000 infantry. The whole of this force was cantoned in and about
Cuellar, while the cavalry allotted to it, Anson’s brigade, took a
more advanced position, along and beyond the Douro, covering not only
its own infantry but the two Spanish divisions of Santocildes, who
had occupied Valladolid on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[p.
502]</span> August 6th. The remainder of the Army of Galicia was still
occupied in the interminable siege of Astorga, which to Wellington’s
disgust still lingered on. The heavy guns had at last come up from
Corunna, but the bombardment seemed to have little effect. Silveira
had resumed the blockade of Zamora, but having no siege artillery
could only wait till starvation should compel its garrison of 700
men to submit. Toro and Tordesillas were the only other places where
Marmont had left a detachment; the latter surrendered to Santocildes
on his march to Valladolid—about 300 French were taken there. The
former was still holding out, observed by a small Spanish force. The
task of keeping a close look-out upon Clausel was handed over to the
guerrilleros—the Castilian chiefs Saornil, Marquinez, and Principe.
An English officer, who spent some days with the two last at this
juncture, describes them as ‘bandits, but very troublesome ones for
the French.’ Deducting the Spaniards left before Astorga, and the
Portuguese left before Zamora, there were some 18,000 men in all told
off to ‘contain’ Clausel. The orders left behind<a id="FNanchor_648"
href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> were that they should
remain in their cantonments unless the enemy should move—which
Wellington did not think a likely contingency, ‘as they have nothing
but their cavalry in a state fit for service.’ But if, rallying sooner
than he expected, the French should march by Palencia to try to rescue
the garrisons of Astorga and Zamora, Santocildes was to retire, and
to endeavour to defend the line of the Esla, while Silveira was to
raise the blockade of Zamora and fall back behind that same river. If,
instead of making a raid westward to save the garrisons, Clausel should
move against Valladolid and the line of the Douro, Anson’s cavalry was
to retire and join Clinton at Cuellar; and if the enemy came on against
them in full force, both were then to fall back on Segovia. Santocildes
was then directed to endeavour to move round Clausel’s rear, and to cut
his communication with Burgos. Contrary to Wellington’s expectation<a
id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>,
as we shall presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[p.
503]</span> see, the French general made both the moves suggested—he
sent a column to relieve Astorga and Zamora, and marched with his main
body on Valladolid. The consequences of his advance will be related in
their due place.</p>

  <p class="subh3">THE PURSUIT OF KING JOSEPH. MAJALAHONDA.
    WELLINGTON AT&nbsp;MADRID</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus made all his arrangements
for ‘containing’ Clausel, and for dealing with what he considered
the unlikely chance of an offensive move by the Army of Portugal,
Wellington was at liberty to carry out his new strategical move. The
mass of troops collected at Cuellar and its neighbourhood was at
last set in motion, and, after his short halt and time of doubting,
he himself marched against Madrid with the whole remaining force
at his disposal—the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and Light Divisions,
Arentschildt’s, Bock’s, and Ponsonby’s [late Le Marchant’s] cavalry
brigades, the Portuguese infantry of Pack and Bradford, with D’Urban’s
horse of that same nation, as also Carlos de España’s Spanish infantry
and Julian Sanchez’s lancers. The whole, allowing for Salamanca losses
and the wear and tear of the high-roads, amounted to about 36,000 men<a
id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>.
It was ample for the hunting of King Joseph, and sufficient, if Hill
were called up, to face the King and Soult in conjunction, supposing
that the latter should at last evacuate Andalusia and march on Toledo.
Santocildes and Clinton were informed that it was the intention of the
Commander-in-Chief to return to Castile when affairs in the South had
been settled in a satisfactory fashion. No date, of course, could be
assigned: all would depend on Soult’s next move.</p>

<p>On August 7th the vanguard, consisting of the force that
had occupied Segovia—D’Urban’s Portuguese squadrons, the heavy
German dragoons, Macdonald’s horse artillery troop, and one<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[p. 505]</span> light battalion of the
German Legion—marched forward six leagues, ‘five of them against the
collar,’ remarks an artillery officer. The steep route lay past the
royal summer-palace of San Ildefonso, ‘a beautiful place, and most
magnificently fitted up: what is very singular, the French have not
destroyed a single stick of it: the rooms are hung as thick as can be
with paintings <i>of sorts</i><a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651"
class="fnanchor">[651]</a>.’ No hostile vedettes were discovered on the
Guadarrama, and a reconnoitring party pushed as far as the Escurial,
and reported that the enemy’s most outlying picket was at Galapagar,
three or four miles to the south-east of that melancholy pile.
Meanwhile the main body, a march behind the vanguard, started from
Segovia on the 8th, Ponsonby’s dragoons and the 7th Division leading;
then came Alten’s brigade, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Divisions, and Pack.
The rear was brought up by the 1st and Light Divisions and Bradford,
who only started from the neighbourhood of Segovia on the 9th<a
id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>. The
necessity for moving the whole army by a single mountain road—though
it was a well-engineered one—caused the column to be of an immoderate
length, and progress was slow. Head-quarters were at San Ildefonso
on the 8th and 9th August, at Nava Cerrada (beyond the summit of the
Guadarrama) on the 10th, at Torre Lodones near the Escurial on the
11th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile D’Urban, far ahead of the main body, occupied the Escurial
on the 9th, and pushed on cautiously to Galapagar, from whence the
enemy had vanished. His rearguard was discovered at Las Rosas and
Majalahonda, five miles nearer to Madrid. Wellington’s orders were that
his vanguard was to keep well closed up, the Germans close behind the
Portuguese, and that nothing was to be risked till support from the
leading divisions of the army was close at hand. Wherefore on the 10th
D’Urban, finding the French in force at Las Rosas, only advanced a few
miles, and bivouacked on the Guadarrama river at the bridge of Retamar.
He received news from the peasantry that King Joseph was preparing to
evacuate Madrid, that convoys had already started, and that the main
body of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[p. 506]</span> Army
of the Centre was to march by the road of Mostoles on Toledo, where
Soult was expected in a few days. The information—true as regards the
evacuation, false as regards the approach of Soult—was duly sent back
to Wellington, who lay that night at Nava Cerrada, fifteen miles to the
rear, with the 7th Division and Ponsonby’s cavalry<a id="FNanchor_653"
href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>.</p>

<p>Madrid was at this moment a scene of tumult and despair. The King
had retired from Segovia still in a state of uncertainty as to whether
Wellington intended to turn against him, or whether he would pursue
Clausel. He quite recognized the fact that, even if Soult obeyed the
last dispatch sent to him on August 2nd, it would be too late for
him to arrive in time to save Madrid. But there was a pause of some
days, while Wellington was making up his mind at Cuellar, and it was
only on the morning of the 8th that the news arrived that a strong
column (D’Urban and the advanced guard) had started from Segovia on
the preceding day, and that more troops were following. The orders
to make ready for departure were issued at once, and a veritable
panic set in among the French residents and the <i>Afrancesados</i>.
‘Every one,’ wrote a keen observer on the 9th August, ‘is packing up
his valuables and making ready for a flitting. Not to speak of the
many Spaniards of birth and fortune who have committed themselves
to the King’s cause, there is an infinite number of minor officials
and hangers-on of the palace, who by preference or by force of habit
stuck to their old places. All these poor wretches dare not stay
behind when the King goes—their lot would be undoubtedly a dreadful
one, they would fall victims to the ferocious patriotism of their
fellow-citizens, who have never forgiven their desertion. Since the
word for departure went round, every one has been hunting for a
vehicle or a saddle-beast, to get off at all costs. Add to this crowd
a swarm of valets, servants, and dependants of all sorts. Most of the
merchants and officials are, as is natural, taking their families
with them: the caravan will be interminable. All night the noise of
carriages, carts, and wagons, rolling by without a moment’s cessation
under my windows, kept me from sleep.’ On the next morning he adds,
‘More<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[p. 507]</span> than 2,000
vehicles of one sort and another, loaded with bundles and bales and
furniture, with whole families squatting on top, have quitted Madrid.
Adding those who follow on foot or on horseback, there must be easily
10,000 of them. They are mostly without arms, there are numbers of
women, old people, and children: it is a lamentable sight: they take
the Aranjuez road, guarded by a considerable escort<a id="FNanchor_654"
href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>.’</p>

<p>The King, after resigning himself to the retreat, and giving orders
for the departure of the convoy and the greater part of his infantry,
had still one troublesome point to settle. Should he, or should he not,
leave a garrison behind, to defend the great fortified <i>enceinte</i> on
the Retiro heights, outside the eastern gate of the city, which his
brother had constructed, to serve as a citadel to hold down Madrid,
and an arsenal to contain the assortment of stores of all kinds. Heavy
material, especially in the way of artillery—had been accumulating
there since the French occupation began. Here were parked all the guns
captured at Ucles, Almonaçid, and Ocaña, and tens of thousands of
muskets, the spoil of those same fields. There was a whole convoy of
clothing destined for the Army of the South, and much more that Joseph
had caused to be made for his skeleton army of <i>Juramentados</i>. There
were 900 barrels of powder and some millions of rounds of infantry
cartridges, not to speak of much arsenal plant of all kinds. All this
would have either to be blown up or to be defended. The fortifications
were good against guerrilleros or insurgents: there was a double
<i>enceinte</i> and a star-fort in the interior. But against siege-guns
the place could obviously hold out for not more than a limited number
of days. After twenty-four hours of wavering, Joseph—contrary to
Jourdan’s advice—resolved to garrison the Retiro, on the chance that
it might defend itself till Soult reached Toledo, and a counter-attack
upon Madrid became possible. If Soult should not appear, the place
was doomed clearly enough: and the previous behaviour of the Duke of
Dalmatia made it by no means likely that he would present himself
in time. However, the King directed Lafon Blaniac, the governor of
the province of La Mancha, to shut himself in the works, with some
2,000 men, consisting mainly of the drafts belonging to the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[p. 508]</span> Army of Andalusia: he
would not leave any of the Army of the Centre. Probably he considered
that Soult would feel more interest in the fate of the Retiro if
his own men formed its garrison. They were a haphazard assembly,
belonging to some dozen different regiments<a id="FNanchor_655"
href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>, under-officered
and mostly conscripts. But they were all French troops of the line;
no <i>Juramentados</i> were among them. To their charge were handed over
some 500 non-transportable sick of the Army of the Centre, mostly men
who had collapsed under the recent forced marches to and from Blasco
Sancho. They were not in the Retiro, but at the military hospital in
the Prado, outside the fortifications.</p>

<p>Having sent off towards Aranjuez his convoy and the larger part of
his troops, the King was suddenly seized with a qualm that he might
be flying from an imaginary danger. What if the column that had been
heard of on the Guadarrama was simply a demonstration—perhaps half a
dozen squadrons and a few battalions of infantry? He would be shamed
for ever if he evacuated his capital before a skeleton enemy. Obsessed
by this idea, he ordered General Treillard to take the whole of his
cavalry—over 2,000 sabres—and drive in Wellington’s advanced guard at
all costs: Palombini’s Italian division marched out from Madrid to
support the reconnaissance. Treillard was ordered to use every effort
to take prisoners, from whom information could probably be extracted by
judicious questioning.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th the French outpost-line outside of Madrid
had been held only by Reiset’s brigade of dragoons (13th and 18th
regiments), about 700 sabres. It was these troops that D’Urban had
discovered on the previous night at Las Rosas: at dawn he proceeded
to drive them in, making sure that they would retire, as they had
regularly done hitherto. His own force was much the same as that of
the enemy, his three weak regiments (seven squadrons) amounting to a
little over 700 men. But he had with him Macdonald’s horse artillery,
and the French were gunless. Demonstrating against Reiset’s front with
two regiments, D’Urban turned him with the third<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_509">[p. 509]</span> and two guns. The flank movement had its
due effect, and the dragoons gave back, when shelled diagonally from a
convenient slope. They retired as far as the village of Las Rosas, and
made a stand there: but on the flanking movement being repeated, they
again drew back, and passing a second village—Majalahonda—went out of
sight, taking cover in woods in the direction of Mostoles and Boadilla.
D’Urban was now within seven miles of Madrid, and thought it well to
write to Wellington to ask whether he should endeavour to enter the
city or not. The reply sent to him was that he was to go no farther
than Aravaca—three miles outside the walls—till he should be supported;
the head of the main column, headed by Ponsonby’s heavy dragoons, would
be up by the evening.</p>

<p>Long before this answer reached him D’Urban was in terrible trouble.
The manœuvring of the morning had taken up some four hours; it was
about 10 when the French disappeared. While waiting for orders, the
brigadier directed his regiments to quarter themselves in Majalahonda,
water their horses, and cook their midday meal. After the pickets had
been thrown out, all went quietly for five hours, and most of the men
were enjoying a siesta at 3.30. They had now support close behind them,
as the heavy German brigade, and the 1st Light Battalion of the K.G.L.
had come up as far as Las Rosas, only three-quarters of a mile to their
rear. The advance was to be resumed when the worst heat of the day
should be over.</p>

<p>But a little before four o’clock masses of French cavalry were seen
debouching from the woods in front of Boadilla. This was Treillard,
who had come up from the rear with four fresh regiments (19th and
22nd Dragoons, Palombini’s Italian <i>Dragons de Napoléon</i>, and the
1st Westphalian Lancers<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656"
class="fnanchor">[656]</a>), and had picked up Reiset’s brigade on
the way. The whole force was over 2,000 strong, and was advancing
in three lines at a great pace, evidently prepared to attack
without hesitation. D’Urban had barely time to form a line in
front of Majalahonda, when the enemy were upon him.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[p. 510]</span></p> <p>It is certain that
the wise policy would have been to make a running fight of it, and
to fall back at once on the Germans at Las Rosas, for the Portuguese
were outnumbered three to one. But D’Urban was a daring leader,
honourably ambitious of distinction, and the excellent behaviour of his
brigade at Salamanca had inspired him with an exaggerated confidence
in their steadiness. He sent back messengers to hurry up the German
dragoons, and took position in front of Majalahonda, throwing out one
squadron in skirmishing line<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657"
class="fnanchor">[657]</a>, deploying five more in line of battle (1st
and 12th regiments), and keeping one in reserve on his left flank to
cover four horse artillery guns there placed. Here also were placed
a party of forty of the German Dragoons, who had been sent out on
exploring duty, and joined the Portuguese in time for the fight.</p>

<p>Treillard came on in three successive lines of brigades, each
composed of six squadrons, Reiset’s dragoons (13th and 18th) forming
the front line, the other dragoon brigade (19th and 22nd) the second,
and the two foreign regiments the reserve. The clash came very quickly,
before the British guns had time to fire more than three or four
rounds. The Portuguese rode forward briskly enough till they were
within a few yards of the enemy, when they checked, wavered, and went
about, leaving their brigadier and their colonels, who were riding well
in front, actually in the French ranks. D’Urban cut his way out—the
Visconde de Barbaçena and Colonel Lobo were both severely wounded and
taken prisoners. The broken line shivered in all directions, and went
to the rear pursued by the French: some of the fugitives rode into and
carried away the reserve squadron, which abandoned the guns on the
left as they were limbering up. There was a wild chase for the mile
that intervened between the battle spot in front of Majalahonda and
the village of Las Rosas. In it three of the four horse artillery guns
were captured—one by a wheel breaking, the other two by their drivers
being cut down by the pursuing dragoons. Captain Dyneley, commanding
the left section of the battery, and fourteen of his men were taken
prisoners—mostly wounded. The small party of German dragoons,
under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[p. 511]</span> an officer
named Kuhls, who chanced to be present, made a desperate attempt to
save the guns. ‘Oh, how those poor fellows behaved!’ wrote Dyneley,
‘they were not much more than twenty in number, but when they saw the
scrape our guns were in, they formed up to support us, which they had
no sooner done than down came at least 150 dragoons and lancers: the
poor fellows fought like men, but of course they were soon overpowered,
and every soul of them cut to pieces.’</p>

<p>The main body of the leading French brigade rode, without a check,
up to the first houses of Las Rosas, where they found the German
heavy brigade only just getting into order, so swift had the rout
been. When D’Urban’s first alarm came to hand, the horses were all
unsaddled, the men, some asleep, some occupied in grooming their mounts
or leading them to water. The trumpets blew, but the squadrons were
only just assembling, when in a confused mass and a cloud of dust
flying Portuguese and pursuing French hurtled in among them. That no
irreparable disaster took place was due to two causes—two captains<a
id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>,
who had got a few of these men already together, gallantly charged
the head of the French to gain time, and some of the light infantry
opened a spattering fire upon them from the houses. Reiset called back
his regiments to re-form them, and meanwhile the Germans came pouring
out of the village and got into line anyhow, ‘some on barebacked
horses, some with bare heads, others in forage-caps, many in their
shirt-sleeves.’ By the time that the French were advancing again,
all the four squadrons of the heavies were more or less in line, and
D’Urban had rallied the greater part of his Portuguese on their left.
The fight in front of Las Rosas was very fierce, though the Portuguese
soon had enough of it and retired. But the Germans made a splendid
resistance, and ended by beating back the front line of the enemy.
Treillard then put in his second line, and under the charge of these
fresh squadrons the dragoons of the Legion, still fighting obstinately,
were pressed back to the entrance of the village: Colonel Jonquières,
commanding the brigade in Bock’s absence, was taken prisoner with a
few of his men. The salvation of the overmatched cavalry was that
the light infantry battalion of the Legion<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_512">[p. 512]</span> had now lined the outskirts of the
village, and opened such a hot fire that the enemy had to draw back.</p>

<p>What Treillard would have done had he been left undisturbed it is
impossible to say, but just at this moment Ponsonby’s cavalry brigade
and the head of the infantry column of the 7th Division came in sight
from the rear, hurrying up to support the vanguard. The French drew
off, and retired in mass, with such haste that they did not even bring
off the captured guns, which were found by the roadside not much
damaged, though an attempt had been made to destroy their carriages.</p>

<p>In this fierce fight, which was so honourable to the Germans and
so much the reverse to the Portuguese, the vanguard lost nearly 200
men. The heavy brigade had 1 officer and 13 men killed, 5 officers and
35 men wounded, 1 officer (Colonel Jonquières) and 6 men prisoners.
The Portuguese naturally suffered much more—by their own fault,
for it was in the rout that they were cut up. They had 3 officers
and 30 men killed, 3 officers and 49 men wounded, and 1 officer<a
id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
and 22 men missing. Macdonald’s unfortunate battery lost 6 killed, 6
wounded, and its second captain (Dyneley) and 14 men missing: most
of the latter were more or less hurt. The K.G.L. light battalion had
7 wounded. The total casualty list, therefore, was 15 officers and
182 men. It is probable that the French did not suffer much less,
for they had as many as 17 officers disabled, including Reiset, the
brigadier who led the first line, and 11 more of the officers of his
two regiments: the supporting corps lost only 5 officers wounded
among the four of them<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660"
class="fnanchor">[660]</a>. But a loss of 17 officers must certainly
imply that of at least 150 men: the Germans had used their broadswords
most effectively. Treillard sought to diminish the effect of his loss
by making the preposterous statement that he had killed 150 of the
allies, wounded 500, and carried off 60 prisoners; he forgot also to
mention that he left the three captured guns behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[p. 513]</span>After this
affair Wellington made the memorandum: ‘the occurrences of the 22nd of
July [Salamanca] had induced me to hope that the Portuguese dragoons
would have conducted themselves better, or I should not have placed
them at the outposts of the army. I shall not place them again in
situations in which, by their misconduct, they can influence the
safety of other troops<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661"
class="fnanchor">[661]</a>.’ It is fair to D’Urban’s men, however,
to remember that they were put into action against superior numbers,
and with a knowledge that they themselves were unsupported, while the
enemy had two lines of reserve behind him. To be broken under such
circumstances was perhaps inevitable. But the second rout, in the
vicinity of Las Rosas, was much more discreditable. Their brigadier,
very reticent in his dispatch to Wellington, wrote in a private letter:
‘The same men who at Salamanca followed me into the French ranks
like British dragoons, on this 11th of August at the first charge
went just far enough to leave me in the midst of the enemy’s ranks.
In the second, which, having got them rallied, I attempted, I could
not get them within ten yards of the enemy-they left me alone, and
vanished from before the helmets like leaves before the autumn wind<a
id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.’</p>

<p>Treillard brought back to King Joseph the news that Wellington in
person was certainly marching on Madrid with the greater part of his
army. Indeed his prisoners had tried to scare him by saying that 8,000
horse were coming down on him, and otherwise exaggerating the numbers
of the allies. The cavalry brigades fell back to form the rearguard
of the King’s army, which moved on Valdemoro and Aranjuez, not toward
Toledo, for certain information had come that none of Soult’s troops
were anywhere near that ancient city. The convoy had been turned
towards Ocaña, and the road to Valencia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[p. 514]</span>Wellington
entered Madrid unopposed next day—vexed that his arrival should have
been marred by the untoward business at Majalahonda, ‘a devil of an
affair,’ as he called it in a private letter to Stapleton Cotton<a
id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>.
But the inhabitants of the Spanish capital took little heed of the
mishap—the departure of the French was the only thing that mattered.
Their enthusiasm was unbounded.</p>

<p>‘I never witnessed,’ wrote an intelligent observer in the ranks<a
id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>,
‘such a scene before. For a distance of five miles from the gates
the road was crowded with the people who had come out to meet us,
each bringing something—laurel boughs, flowers, bread, wine, grapes,
lemonade, sweetmeats, &amp;c. The road was like a moving forest from
the multitude who carried palms, which they strewed in the way for us
to march over. Young ladies presented us with laurel, and even fixed
it in our caps: others handed us sweetmeats and fruit. Gentlemen had
hired porters to bring out wine, which they handed to us as we passed
by: every individual strove to outvie each other in good nature. On
the other hand the feelings of each British soldier were wound up to
the highest pitch—Wellington himself rode at the head of our regiment,
we were flushed with victory, and a defeated enemy was flying in
our front: proud of the honour paid us by the people, we entered
Madrid, the air rent with cries of “Long live Wellington, Long live
the English.” The crowd and shouts and ringing of bells was beyond
description. The men on the flanks were involuntarily dragged out of
their subdivisions into houses, and treated with the best that could be
found for them. It was with difficulty that Lord Wellington could keep
his seat on horseback-every one was pressing round him.’ They kissed
his hands, his sword, even his horse and the ground he had passed
over. It would have been a moment of intoxicating exultation to most
men: but Wellington looked beyond the laurels and the shouting. ‘It
is impossible to describe the joy of the inhabitants on our arrival:’
he wrote, in his rather ponderous style, ‘I hope that the prevalence
of the same sentiment of detestation of the French yoke which first
induced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[p. 515]</span> them to set
the example of resistance to the usurper, will again induce them to
make exertions in the cause of their country, which, being more wisely
directed, will be more efficacious than those they formerly made<a
id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>.’ But
hope is not the same as expectation.</p>

<p>That evening the whole city was illuminated, and the streets were
so full, till long after midnight, of crowds tumultuously joyful, that
some cautious officers feared that the French garrison of the Retiro
might sally out to make mischief in the confusion. Lafon-Blaniac,
however, kept quiet—he was already quailing over two discoveries—the
one that his water supply was very short, the other that the inner
<i>enceinte</i> of the works was so full of miscellaneous combustible stuff,
shot in at the last moment, that nothing was more probable than a
general conflagration if he were to be bombarded. It had also begun
to strike him that his outer line of defences was very weak, and his
second one very constricted for the amount of men and material that he
had in charge. The larger <i>enceinte</i>, indeed, only consisted, for the
greater part of its extent, of the loopholed wall of the Retiro Park,
with some <i>flèches</i> placed in good flanking positions. On the side
facing the Prado were buildings—the Retiro Palace and the Museum, which
had been barricaded and made tenable: they formed the strongest section
of the exterior line. The inner <i>enceinte</i> was a more formidable
affair—with ten bastioned fronts on the scale of a powerful field-work.
The star-fort, which constituted the final refuge for the garrison, was
built around the solid building that had once been the royal porcelain
manufactory (where the celebrated Buen Retiro china was made): it had
a ditch twelve feet deep and twenty-four wide, and was formidably
palisaded.</p>

<p>Wellington reconnoitred the works on the 13th, and directed that
the outer line should be stormed that night. Three hundred men of the
3rd Division were told off to break into the Park wall on the north,
near the Bull-Ring: 300 more from the 51st and 68th regiments of the
7th Division were to attack the south-west angle of the <i>enceinte</i>,
which was formed by the wall of the Botanical Garden. Both assaults
were completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[p. 516]</span>
successful—the walls were so flimsy that they were easily hewn through
with picks, or beaten in with beams used as battering-rams, and the
68th found and broke open a postern. The resistance was very weak—only
ten of the storming-parties were killed or wounded, and the enemy
retired almost at once into his second line, abandoning the Palace and
other fortified buildings.</p>

<p>Lafon-Blaniac was now in a deplorable position, for there was only
one well of moderate capacity within the second <i>enceinte</i> to serve
the whole garrison. He had lost those in the Palace at the foot of the
hill: and the old porcelain manufactory, within the star-fort, had been
wont to be supplied by a little aqueduct, which had of course been
cut by the British. It was clear that a lack of water would soon be a
serious problem: but a superfluity of fire was a still more probable
one—the garrison was crowded up among buildings and stores, and the
large factory inside the star-fort was specially dangerous—a very few
shells would suffice to kindle it and to smoke out or smother its
defenders.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th Lafon-Blaniac sent out a flag of truce,
ostensibly to deliver a threat to fire upon the town if he were
pressed, really to see if he could get tolerable terms, before the
British had begun to batter him, for he could note preparations to
bring up heavy guns being made. Wellington saw the <i>parlementaire</i>
in person, and a conclusion was arrived at in a very few minutes.
Tolerable conditions of surrender were granted—the garrison to march
out with honours of war, the officers to keep their swords, horses,
and baggage, the men their knapsacks unsearched. All arms and stores
were to be handed over intact. At four o’clock the French marched out,
‘most of them drunk, and affecting a great rage against the governor
for surrendering so tamely.’ Yet it is clear that he could not have
held out for more than a day or two, with great loss of life and no
strategical profit, since there was absolutely no chance of the place
being relieved. The prisoners were sent off under escort to Lisbon.
On the way they were joined by the garrison of Guadalajara, which
had surrendered with equal facility to the Empecinado—this was a
force of <i>Juramentados</i> and foreigners—regiments Royal-Étranger and
Royal-Irlandais,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[p. 517]</span>
about 900 strong, under a General de Prieux, of the Spanish not the
French service. They feared for their necks if they resisted the
guerrilleros, and made practically no resistance.</p>

<p>The stores in the Retiro proved most useful—nearly every regiment
at Madrid was supplied with new shoes from them: the stock of blue
French regimental coats was issued to the artillery and light dragoons,
to be cut up into jackets; Joseph’s <i>Juramentado</i> uniforms served
to reclothe Carlos de España’s and Julian Sanchez’s men. The most
unexpected find in the fort was the eagles of the 51st Line and 12th
Léger, which had somehow got into the Retiro, though the bulk of
those corps were with Soult’s army, and only detachments of them were
at Madrid. They were sent to the Prince Regent, and now hang in the
chapel of Chelsea Hospital<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666"
class="fnanchor">[666]</a>. The garrison was found to consist of
4 <i>chefs de bataillon</i>, 22 captains, 42 other officers, and 1,982
men—the latter including some 200 non-military employés. In addition,
6 officers and 429 rank and file had been surrendered in the hospital,
which was outside the Retiro, before the attack on the place began<a
id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>.</p>

<p>Here we must leave Wellington for a space, triumphant in the Spanish
capital, and much worried by the polite and effusive attentions of
the authorities and inhabitants, who lavished on him and his officers
banquets, balls, and bull-fights for many days, in spite of the penury
which had been prevailing for years in the half-ruined city. Never
was an army better treated—wine could be had for the asking, and at
last the men had to be confined to their quarters for many hours a
day, lest they should be killed by kindness. The Constitution was
proclaimed in state, a patriotic municipality elected, and Carlos de
España was made governor. He signalized his appointment by arresting a
good many <i>Afrancesados</i> and garotting with much ceremonial the priest
Diego Lopez, who had been one of King Joseph’s most noted spies.<a
id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p class="fs90 mt2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[p.
518]</span><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—For the garrison of the
Retiro I can find no regular details; Wellington gives only totals of
the surrendered force. But a paper of Jourdan’s (at Paris), though
dated so far back as July 17th, speaks of the Madrid garrison as
containing 230 men of the 3/12th Léger, 250 of the 3/45th, and a whole
<i>bataillon de marche</i> more of Soult’s army, 750 strong, together with
200 <i>hommes isolés</i>, and a considerable number of dismounted cavalry.
I suspect that these formed the Retiro garrison in August as well
as in July. The other troops noted as left at Madrid on July 18th—a
battalion of Nassau, the dépôts of the Royal Guard, 28th and 75th, and
three Spanish battalions, were certainly <i>not</i> in the surrender, and
had marched off on August 10th with the King. But a good many scores
of the 50th, belonging to Marmont’s army, were among the prisoners. I
suspect that these were the garrison of Avila, which retired on Madrid
on getting the news of the battle of Salamanca.</p>

  <p class="subh3">AFFAIRS IN THE SOUTH. JUNE-AUGUST 1812.<br />
    SOULT, HILL, AND BALLASTEROS</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> months elapsed between Wellington’s
passage of the Agueda on his offensive march into the kingdom of Leon,
and his triumphal entry into Madrid. During this critical time there
had been constant alarms and excursions in Andalusia and Estremadura,
but nothing decisive had occurred. This was all that Wellington wanted:
if employment were found for the French Army of the South, so that it
got no chance of interfering with the campaign on the Douro, he was
perfectly satisfied, and asked for nothing more.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that his instructions to Hill, before he
started on the march to Salamanca, were that Soult must be diverted as
far as possible from sending troops northward. The main scheme was that
Ballasteros and Hill should, if possible, combine their operations so
as to bring pressure upon the enemy alternately<a id="FNanchor_669"
href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. The Cadiz Regency
had readily agreed to stir up the Spanish general to activity: if he
would demonstrate once more (as in April) against Seville, so as to
attract Soult’s attention, and cause him to concentrate, Hill should
press in upon Drouet and the French troops in Estremadura, so as to
force the Marshal to draw off from the Spaniard. Similarly, if Soult
should concentrate against Hill, Ballasteros was to strike again
at Seville, or the rear of the Cadiz Lines, which would infallibly
bring the Marshal southward again in haste<a id="FNanchor_670"
href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[p. 520]</span>When Wellington
crossed the Agueda [June 13] Hill had his corps collected in central
Estremadura—head-quarters at Almendralejo, the troops cantoned about
Ribera, Villafranca, Fuente del Maestre, and Los Santos, with Penne
Villemur’s Spanish horse in front at Zafra. Hill had in hand his old
force—the 2nd Division and Hamilton’s Portuguese, with two (instead of
the usual one) British and one Portuguese cavalry brigades. He could
also call up, if needed, the three strong Portuguese infantry regiments
(5th, 17th, 22nd) which were holding Badajoz till a sufficient native
garrison should be provided for it. At present only a few hundred
Spaniards [Tiradores de Doyle] had appeared. Far away, to the north
of the Guadiana, observing the French posts on the Tagus, there was a
detached Portuguese cavalry regiment at Plasencia. This outlying unit
was also put under Hill’s charge: its object was to give early notice
of any possible stir by the French, in the direction of Almaraz or the
recently restored bridge of Alcantara. Morillo’s infantry division
of Castaños’s army was lying on the right of Hill, in south-western
Estremadura: Wellington suggested that the Spanish general might be
willing to throw it into Badajoz, and so liberate the Portuguese
regiments lying there, if Soult should advance before the regular
garrison intended for the great fortress should arrive from Cadiz.
The whole force watching Soult amounted to nearly 19,000 men, not
including the Spaniards. Of this total about 7,500 sabres and bayonets
were British—something over 11,000 were Portuguese. In addition,
Morillo and Penne Villemur had not quite 4,000 Spanish horse and foot.
Supposing that a minimum garrison were thrown into Badajoz—Morillo’s
infantry for choice—Hill could dispose of 18,000 Anglo-Portuguese for
field-operations, not including the Portuguese cavalry by the Tagus,
who had the separate duty of watching the Army of the Centre.</p>

<p>The French in Estremadura still consisted of the old con<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[p. 521]</span>tingent which D’Erlon
had been administering since the year began, viz. his own and
Daricau’s infantry divisions, with Lallemand’s and Perreymond’s
cavalry—altogether not more than 12,000 men, for several of the
infantry regiments had lost a battalion apiece when Badajoz fell. Since
his excursion to Don Benito and Medellin at the time of Hill’s raid on
Almaraz, D’Erlon had drawn back, abandoning all southern and most of
eastern Estremadura to the allies. He himself was lying at Azuaga and
Fuente Ovejuna, on the slopes of the Sierra Morena, while Daricau was
more to the north, about Zalamea, rather too far off to give his chief
prompt support. Daricau’s detachment in this direction seems to have
been caused by a desire to make communication with the Army of Portugal
easy, if the latter should ever come southward again from the Tagus,
and push to Truxillo as in 1811. It was clear that unless Soult should
reinforce his troops to the north of the mountains, Hill need fear
nothing: indeed he had a distinct superiority over D’Erlon.</p>

<p>Early in June, however, there was no danger that any troops from
Seville would come northward, for Ballasteros’s diversion had taken
place somewhat earlier than Wellington had wished, and the disposable
reserve of the Army of Andalusia was far away in the extreme southern
point of the province. After his success at Alhaurin in April, and his
subsequent pursuit by Soult’s flying columns, Ballasteros had taken
refuge—as was his wont when hard pressed—under the guns of Gibraltar.
The French retired when they had consumed their provisions, and fell
back to their usual stations at Malaga and Ronda, and along the line
of the Guadalete. When they were gone, the Spanish general emerged in
May, and recommenced his wonted incursions, ranging over the whole
of the mountains of the South. Having received the dispatches of the
Regency, which directed him to execute a diversion in favour of the
allied army in Estremadura, he obeyed with unexpected celerity, and
took in hand a very bold enterprise. General Conroux, with the column
whose task it was to cover the rear of the Cadiz Lines, was lying at
Bornos, behind the Guadalete, in a slightly entrenched camp. He had
with him about 4,500 men<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671"
class="fnanchor">[671]</a>. Ballasteros<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_522">[p. 522]</span> resolved to attempt to surprise him, on
the morning of June 1. Having got together all his disposable troops,
8,500 infantry and a few squadrons of horse<a id="FNanchor_672"
href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>, he made a forced
march, and, favoured by a heavy mist at dawn, fell upon the enemy’s
cantonments and surprised them. He won a considerable success at
first: but the French rallied, and after a hard fight broke his line
by a general charge, and drove him back across the Guadalete. Conroux
was too exhausted to pursue, and Ballasteros remained in position,
apparently meditating a second attack, when on seeing some cavalry
detachments coming up to join the enemy, he sullenly retired. He had
lost 1,500 men and 4 guns, the French over 400<a id="FNanchor_673"
href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>. The first note of
alarm from Bornos had caused Soult to send what reserves he could
collect from the Cadiz Lines and Seville—six battalions and two
cavalry regiments, and since Ballasteros had been beaten, but not
routed, he thought it necessary to give prompt attention to him.
Thereupon the Spaniard retreated first to Ubrique, and when threatened
in that position, to his old refuge in the lines of San Roque before
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Soult would have liked to make an end of him, and would also have
been glad to direct a new attack upon Tarifa, which served as a second
base to the roving Spanish corps; he mentions his wish to capture it
in more than one of his dispatches of this summer. But his attention
was drawn away from Ballasteros and the South by the prompt advance
of Hill, who (as had been settled) pressed in upon Drouet at the
right moment. On the 7th June he moved forward his head-quarters from
Almendralejo to Fuente del Maestre, and two days later to Zafra. On the
11th, Penne Villemur’s cavalry pushed out from Llerena towards Azuaga,
while Slade’s brigade, advancing parallel with the Spanish general,
pressed forward from Llera on Maguilla, a village some fifteen miles in
front of Drouet’s head-quarters at Fuente Ovejuna. This reconnaissance
in force brought on the most unlucky combat that was ever fought<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[p. 523]</span> by the British cavalry
during the Peninsular War, the skirmish of Maguilla.</p>

<p>Slade, an officer whose want of capacity we have before had
occasion to notice<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674"
class="fnanchor">[674]</a>, after some hours of march began to get
in touch with French dragoon vedettes, and presently, after driving
them in, found himself facing Lallemand’s brigade. Their forces were
nearly equal—each having two regiments, Slade the 1st Royals and 3rd
Dragoon Guards, Lallemand the 17th and 27th Dragoons—they had about 700
sabres a side: if anything Slade was a little the stronger. The French
general showed considerable caution and retired for some distance,
till he had nearly reached Maguilla, where he turned to fight. Slade
at once charged him, with the Royals in front line and the 3rd Dragoon
Guards supporting. The first shock was completely successful, the
French line being broken, and more than 100 men being taken. But Slade
then followed the routed squadrons with headlong recklessness, ‘each
regiment,’ as he wrote in his very foolish report of the proceedings,
‘vying with the other which should most distinguish itself.’ The
pursuit was as reckless as that of the 13th Light Dragoons at Campo
Mayor in the preceding year, and resolved itself into a disorderly
gallop of several miles. After the French had passed a defile beyond
Maguilla a sudden cry was heard, ‘Look to your right’—a fresh squadron
which Lallemand had left in reserve was seen bearing down on the flank
of the disordered mass. Charged diagonally by a small force, but one
in good order, the British dragoons gave way. Lallemand’s main body
turned upon them, and ‘the whole brigade in the greatest disorder, and
regardless of all the exertions and appeals of their general and their
regimental officers, continued their disgraceful flight till victors
and fugitives, equally overcome and exhausted by the overpowering heat
and the clouds of thick dust, came to a standstill near Valencia de las
Torres, some four miles from Maguilla, where at last Slade was able
to collect his regiments, and to retire to the woods beyond Llera<a
id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>.’</p>

<p>In this discreditable affair Slade lost 22 killed, 26 wounded,
and no less than 2 officers and 116 men taken prisoners—most<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[p. 524]</span> of the latter wounded—a
total casualty list of 166. Lallemand acknowledges in his report a
loss of 51 officers and men<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676"
class="fnanchor">[676]</a>. The defeated general irritated Wellington
by a very disingenuous report, in which he merely wrote that ‘I am
sorry to say our loss was severe, as the enemy brought up a support,
and my troops being too eager in pursuit, we were obliged to relinquish
a good number of prisoners that we had taken, and to fall back on
Llera.’ He then added, in the most inappropriate phrases, ‘nothing
could exceed the gallantry displayed by both officers and men on
this occasion, in which Colonels Calcraft and Clinton, commanding
the two regiments, distinguished themselves, as well as all the
other officers present<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677"
class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.’</p>

<p>Wellington’s scathing comment, in a letter to Hill, was: ‘I have
never been more annoyed than by Slade’s affair, and I entirely concur
with you in the necessity of inquiring into it. It is occasioned
entirely by the trick our officers of cavalry have acquired, of
galloping at everything—and then galloping <i>back</i> as fast as they
galloped <i>on</i> the enemy. They never consider their situation, never
think of manœuvring before an enemy—so little that one would think
they cannot manœuvre except on Wimbledon Common: and when they use
their arm as it ought to be used, viz. offensively, they never keep nor
provide for a reserve.... The Royals and 3rd Dragoon Guards were the
best cavalry regiments in this country, and it annoys me particularly
that the misfortune has happened to them. I do not wonder at the
French boasting of it: it is the greatest blow they have struck<a
id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>.’ It
is curious to find that Slade retained command of his brigade till May
1813. One would have expected to find him relegated to Great Britain at
a much earlier date. But Wellington was not even yet in full control
of the removal or promotion of his senior officers. Other generals
with whom he was equally discontented, such as Erskine and Long, were
also left upon his hands after he had set a black mark against their
names.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[p. 525]</span></p>
<p>The combat of Maguilla, however unsatisfactory in itself, made no
difference to the general strategy of the campaign. Drouet, having
drawn back on Hill’s advance, sent messages to Soult, to the effect
that unless he were strongly reinforced he must retire from the Sierra
Morena, and cover the roads to Cordova on the Andalusian side of the
mountains. He reported that he had only 6,000 men in hand, and that
Hill was coming against him with 30,000, including the Spaniards. Both
these figures were fantastic—for reasons best known to himself D’Erlon
did not include Daricau’s division in his own total, while he credited
Hill with 15,000 men in the 2nd British division alone [which was
really 8,000 strong, including its Portuguese brigade], and reported
with circumstantial detail that the 7th Division had come down from
Portalegre and joined the 2nd<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679"
class="fnanchor">[679]</a>.</p>

<p>Soult sent on D’Erlon’s dispatch to Madrid, with the comment that
Hill’s advance showed that the main intention of Wellington was
certainly to attack Andalusia, and not to fall upon Marmont. But that
he did not consider such an attack very imminent is sufficiently
shown by the fact that he detached to Drouet’s aid only one division
of infantry, that of Barrois—which composed his central reserve—and
one of cavalry, that of Pierre Soult, or a total of 6,000 infantry
and 2,200 cavalry: such a reinforcement would have been futile if he
had really believed that Wellington was marching against Seville.
His real view may be gathered from his estimate of Hill’s force at
15,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 5,000 Spaniards—a total very remote from
the alarmist reports of Drouet, and not far from the truth. The
reinforcement sent under Barrois would give the Estremaduran detachment
a practical equality in numbers with Hill, and a great superiority in
quality. The orders sent to Drouet were that he was to advance against
Hill, to strive to get him to an engagement, at any rate to ‘contain’
him, so that he should not detach troops north of the Guadiana to join
Wellington or to demonstrate against Madrid. If things went well,
Drouet was to invest Badajoz, and to occupy Merida, from whence he
would try to get into communication via Truxillo with the troops of
the Army of the Centre. The final paragraph<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_526">[p. 526]</span> of his directions stated that Drouet’s
main object must be to make such a formidable diversion that Wellington
would have to reinforce Hill. ‘When the Army of Portugal finds that
it has less of the English army in front of it, we may perhaps
persuade it [i. e. Marmont] that the enemy’s plan is certainly to
invade the provinces of the south of Spain before he acts directly
against the North: then, no doubt, changed dispositions will be made.’
Unfortunately for the strategical reputation of Soult, Wellington
crossed the Agueda with seven of his eight divisions to attack Marmont,
on the very day after this interesting dispatch was written.</p>

<p>D’Erlon had been promised that Barrois should march to his aid
on the 14th, but it was not till the 16th that the column from
Seville started to join him, and then it marched not by the route of
Constantina and Guadalcanal, as D’Erlon had requested, but by the
high-road from Andalusia to Badajoz, via Monasterio. If Hill had been
pressing the troops in front of him with vigour, the French would have
been in an awkward position, since they were on separate roads, and
might have been driven apart, and kept from junction by a decisive
movement from Llerena, where Hill’s cavalry and advanced guard lay.
But the British general had orders to attract the attention of Soult
and to ‘contain’ as many of the enemy as possible, rather than to
risk anything. He resolved, when he heard of the approach of Barrois,
to retire to the heights of Albuera, which Wellington had pointed
out to him as the most suitable position for standing at bay, if he
were pressed hard. Accordingly he drew back by slow stages from Zafra
towards Badajoz, covering his rear by his cavalry, which suffered
little molestation. Barrois joined Drouet at Bienvenida near Zafra
on the 19th, and their united force, since Daricau had come in to
join them from the direction of Zalamea, with the greater part of
his division, must have amounted to over 18,000 men, though Drouet
in a report to King Joseph states it at a decidedly lower figure<a
id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>.
They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[p. 527]</span> advanced
cautiously as far as Villafranca and Fuente del Maestre, which their
infantry occupied on June 21, while their numerous cavalry lay a little
way in front, at Villalba, Azeuchal, and Almendralejo. On the same day
Hill had taken up the Albuera position, on which several points had
been entrenched.</p>

<p>As Hill had just called out the three garrison regiments of
Portuguese from Badajoz, he had now between 18,000 and 19,000 of his
own army in position, besides Villemur’s Spanish cavalry. This last,
together with Long’s and Slade’s squadrons, were thrown out in front
of the Albuera river, with their vedettes in Santa Marta, Almendral,
and Corte de Peleas, only a mile or two from the French advanced posts.
They were directed not to give way till they were severely pressed,
as Hill wished to avoid at all costs the kind of surprise that had
befallen Beresford in 1811, when Long had retired so precipitately
before the French horse that he could give no account of their
strength, nor of the position of Soult’s infantry. But the expected
advance of the enemy hung fire—from the 21st onwards Hill was waiting
to be attacked, and sending almost daily accounts of the situation to
Wellington: but the main body of the French moved no farther forward.
This was all the more surprising to the English general because he had
intercepted a letter written on May 31 from King Joseph to Drouet,
in which the latter was directed to ‘passer sur le corps à Hill<a
id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>,’
and then to come up to the Tagus to join the Army of the Centre. Not
knowing how entirely Soult and D’Erlon were ignoring all orders from
Madrid, both Wellington and his trusty lieutenant thought that such
instructions must almost certainly bring about an action. The former
wrote to the latter on June 28th, after receiving several statements of
the situation: ‘if you should find that Drouet separates his troops,
or if he pretends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[p. 528]</span>
to hold you in check with a smaller body of men than you think you can
get the better of, fall upon him, but take care to keep a very large
proportion of your troops in reserve.... I should prefer a partial
affair to a general one, but risk a general affair—keeping always a
large body of reserve, particularly of cavalry—rather than allow Drouet
to remain in Estremadura and keep you in check.’ But the enemy neither
came on for a general action, nor scattered his troops so widely as to
induce Hill to risk an attack on any point of his line. He remained
with his infantry massed about Villafranca and Fuente del Maestre, and
only demonstrated with his cavalry.</p>

<p>The cause of this inactivity on Drouet’s part was partly,
perhaps, his over-estimate of Hill’s strength, but much more Soult’s
unwillingness to obey the orders sent him from Madrid. He was
determined not to detach a third part of his army to the Tagus, to
join the Army of the Centre. He was by this time fully embarked on
his long course of insubordinate action, with which we have already
dealt when writing of the King’s desires and their frustration<a
id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>.
On the 26th May Joseph had sent him the dispatch which directed that
D’Erlon must come up northward, if Wellington’s main attack turned
out to be directed against Marmont and the Army of Portugal: ‘his
corps is the pivot on which everything turns: he is the counterpoise
which can be thrown into the balance in one scale or the other,
according as our forces have to act on the one side or the other<a
id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>.’
Drouet himself had at the same time received that order to the same
effect, sent to him directly and not through his immediate superior,
which so much scandalized Soult’s sense of hierarchical subordination<a
id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>.
On getting the Madrid dispatch of May 26 upon June 8th, Soult had
written to say that Wellington’s real objective was Andalusia and not
the North, that Marmont was utterly misled if he supposed that he was
to be attacked by the main body of the allies, that Graham, with two
British divisions, was still at Portalegre in support of Hill, and that
Drouet had therefore been forbidden to lose touch with the Army of
the South by passing towards the Tagus. If he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_529">[p. 529]</span> departed, the whole fabric of French
power in the South would go to pieces, ‘I should have to pack up and
evacuate Andalusia after the smallest check.’ Drouet should ‘contain’
Hill, but could do no more. In a supplementary dispatch of June 12,
provoked by the receipt of Joseph’s direct orders to Drouet, Soult
went further, definitely stating that the troops in Estremadura
should not go to the Tagus, ‘where they would be lost to the Army
of the South, but would never arrive in time to help the Army of
Portugal.’ If Drouet passed the Tagus, Hill would march on Seville,
and on the sixth day would capture that insufficiently garrisoned
capital, put himself in communication with Ballasteros, and raise the
siege of Cadiz. ‘I repeat that the Army of the South cannot carry out
its orders, and send Count D’Erlon and 15,000 men to the valley of
the Tagus, without being compelled to evacuate Andalusia within the
fortnight.... If your Majesty insists, remove me from command, I do not
wish to be responsible for the inevitable disaster that must follow<a
id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>.’</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p class="mt1">At the same time Drouet, much vexed at having personal
responsibility thrown upon his shoulders, by the King’s direct orders
to him to march without consulting Soult, wrote to Madrid that he was
very weak, that Hill was in front of him with a superior force, and
that Barrois and Pierre Soult, who had just joined him, were under
strict orders not to go beyond the Guadiana, so that if he himself
marched towards the Tagus it would be with a very small force. But he
dare not make that move: ‘I am absolutely obliged to stop where I am
[Villafranca] in presence of Hill, who still remains concentrated on
the Albuera position, which he has entrenched, with at least 25,000
men.’ Indeed an attack by Hill was expected day by day: ‘at the moment
of writing there is lively skirmishing going on at the outposts,
and news has come in that the whole allied army is advancing<a
id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>.’
Drouet, in short, was determined to evade responsibility, and summed
up the situation by the conclusion that he was acting for the best in
‘containing’ Hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[p. 530]</span>
and his very large detachment, who could be of no use to Wellington in
the campaign which the latter was now reported to have begun against
Marmont in the North. He could do no more.</p>

<p>The deadlock in front of the Albuera position lasted for many
days—from June 21st till July 2nd. This was a very trying time for
Hill’s corps—the weather was excessively hot, the ground was hideous
with the insufficiently buried corpses of the battle of last year, and
sickness was very prevalent in some regiments. For the first day or two
after the arrival of the French at Villafranca and Almendralejo, an
attack was expected each morning, but nothing in particular happened.
Drouet kept quiet behind his cavalry screen, and did no more than send
foraging parties out on his flanks, which ravaged the countryside as
far as Merida and Feria. Over-valuing Hill’s strength, he dreaded to
commit himself to an attack on a superior force, covered by field-works
and in a fine position. Nothing was seen of him for ten days, save that
on the 26th he felt the posts of the allies at Corte de Peleas and
Santa Marta, and retired after a little cavalry skirmishing. On July
1, however, he executed a more searching reconnaissance, with three
brigades of cavalry under the direction of Pierre Soult, Vinot’s in
the centre, Sparre’s on the right, Lallemand’s on the left. Barrois’s
infantry division came up in support. Vinot drove in a Portuguese
cavalry regiment of J. Campbell’s brigade from Corte de Peleas<a
id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>,
but retired when he found it supported by Long’s light dragoons in
front of the Albuera position. Lallemand found Santa Marta held by
Penne Villemur’s cavalry, and turned them out of it with considerable
loss, for the Spanish general unwisely offered battle, and was routed
after a very short contest. He retired into the wood of Albuera, whose
edge was occupied by Slade’s heavy dragoons, supported by the pickets
of Byng’s infantry brigade. A troop of the 3rd Dragoon Guards made a
gallant charge to cover the retreat of the Spaniards, and suffered some
loss in bringing them off. Lallemand at dusk pressed forward, and cut
off a small party of the Buffs, who would have been taken prisoners
if a troop of the 2nd Hussars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[p.
531]</span> K.G.L. had not rescued them by a sudden counter-attack.
Sparre’s brigade on the right did no more than skirmish with the
allied outposts along the lower course of the river Albuera. At night
all the French cavalry retired, and D’Erlon wrote to Soult that his
reconnaissance had ‘completely fulfilled its object,’ by making him
certain that Hill had 25,000 foot, 3,000 horse, and a very strong force
of artillery in position, so that it would be insane to attack him<a
id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>.</p>

<p>On the next morning, July 2nd, Hill determined to make use of
Wellington’s permission to bring on an action, if he should judge that
Drouet was not strong enough to face him. The weakness of the French
demonstration had convinced him that the enemy was not ready to fight.
Collecting the whole of his army, he advanced from the Albuera position
towards Santa Marta, thus challenging Drouet to a fight. The enemy’s
vedettes made no stand and retired when pushed. On reaching Santa Marta
Hill halted for the night in battle order, and on the morning of the
3rd resumed his movement, which was directed to cutting off Drouet from
the great road to Seville. While Erskine with the light cavalry (Long,
and J. Campbell’s Portuguese) advanced down the high-road to Villalba,
supported by one British and one Portuguese brigade of infantry, Hill
himself, with the rest of his army, executed a flank march to Feria,
and, having got behind the French left wing, turned inward and moved
toward Los Santos. The enemy’s main body, at Villafranca and Fuente
del Maestre, were thus prevented from using the high-road to Seville,
and placed in a position which compelled Drouet either to fight, or to
retire south-eastward towards Usagre and Llerena.</p>

<p>Next morning (July 4) Hill expected a battle, for Barrois’s division
and all Pierre Soult’s cavalry were found in a strong position at
Fuente del Maestre, and the rest of the French were close behind at
Almendralejo. But when he continued his movement toward the right,
outflanking Barrois instead of attacking him, the enemy gave way
and retired, protected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[p.
532]</span> his cavalry, retreating on Ribera, Hinojosa, and Usagre<a
id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>.
There was lively skirmishing between the squadrons of the British
advanced guard, and those of the French rearguard, but no serious
engagement.</p>

<p>The same general plan of action continued on the 5th. Hill,
keeping his army well concentrated, moved in two columns on Usagre
and Bienvenida, the bulk of his cavalry riding at the head of his
left-hand column and pressing in the French horse. Drouet took up a
position at Valencia de las Torres, where he had found strong ground,
and thought on the 6th that he would risk a defensive action. But
Hill, instead of marching in upon him, continued his flanking movement
towards Llerena. Thereupon Drouet, finding that he would be cut off
from Andalusia if he remained in his chosen position, evacuated it and
fell back by Maguilla on Berlanga and Azuaga [July 7]. The two armies
had thus got back into exactly the same positions in which they had
lain on June 19th, before Hill’s retreat to Albuera. The tale of their
manœuvres bears a curious resemblance to the contemporary movements of
Wellington and Marmont between Salamanca and Tordesillas. In each case
one combatant, when pressed, retired, and took up a strong position
(Marmont at Tordesillas-Pollos-Toro, Hill at Albuera). He then issued
from it after some days, and by persistent flank movements dislodged
his opponent, and drove him back to the same position from which he
had started, so that the situation came back to that which it had been
three weeks before. But here the parallel ended—Marmont pressed his
advantage too far, and got entangled in the disastrous manœuvre of
July 22, which brought on the battle of Salamanca and his own ruin.
Hill, contented with what he had achieved, halted at Llerena, and did
not push matters to a decisive action. He had done all that Wellington
desired in keeping Soult’s attention diverted from Marmont’s peril, and
in ‘containing’ a hostile force as great as his own. Moreover he had
driven it off the road to Seville, and if it retreated on Andalusia it
would have to be on Cordova, by the road of Constantina, since no other
remained available.</p>

<p>But a new development of this complicated and indecisive<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[p. 533]</span> campaign began on
July 10th. Drouet, thinking apparently that Hill’s farther advance
might be stopped as effectively by assuming a position on his flank
as by direct opposition in front, shifted his right wing (Daricau’s
division and Sparre’s and Vinot’s cavalry) back to Zalamea and its
neighbourhood, where Daricau had lain in May and June. He himself
resumed his old head-quarters at Fuente Ovejuna. Now just at this time
Hill received an intercepted letter of King Joseph to Drouet, dated
June 21st, which repeated in angry terms the long-ignored orders that
the Estremaduran detachment of the Army of the South was to march on
Toledo without delay. ‘Vous aurez sans doute reçu les renforts que
j’ai donné l’ordre au duc de Dalmatie de vous envoyer. Vous devez
avoir quinze mille hommes. Agissez avec ce corps, et tout ce qui est
sous le commandement du général Daricau. Rapprochez-vous de moi:
passez le Tage, et mettez-vous en état d’agir suivant les événements;
n’attendez aucun ordre<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690"
class="fnanchor">[690]</a>.’</p>

<p>The capture of this dispatch coincided with the news that Drouet
had pushed Daricau and a large body of cavalry towards Zalamea. Hill
drew the natural deduction that the French opposite him were at last
about to obey the King’s orders, and to march to the Tagus, via
Zalamea, Medellin, and Truxillo. ‘The intelligence that I have of the
enemy’s movements’ (he wrote to Wellington) ‘indicates his intention
of carrying Joseph’s instructions into execution.... I have received
information [false as it chanced] that Drouet was yesterday at Zalamea,
with his main body, having sent troops by Berlanga and Azuaga. I shall
move immediately in the direction of Zalamea.’ That is to say that if
Drouet was going off northward towards the King, Hill was prepared
to carry out the original instructions which Wellington had left
him, and if he could not stop the enemy, would move parallel to him,
so as to join his chief before Drouet could transfer himself to the
northern sphere of operations. His route would be by Badajoz or Merida
and the newly-restored bridge of Alcantara on Ciudad Rodrigo, a much
shorter one than that of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[p.
534]</span> opponent. He had just begun to move his left wing in the
direction of Merida, when he received a letter from Wellington exactly
conforming to his own ideas. If Drouet is making for the Tagus in
full force, wrote Wellington, you must take all the cavalry except
one English regiment and Campbell’s Portuguese, along with Byng’s and
Howard’s brigades of the 2nd Division, and Hamilton’s division, and
send orders to have all preparations made at Alcantara to lay down the
bridge: your route across the mountains will be by the pass of Perales:
you will find elaborate instructions for the further movement at Ciudad
Rodrigo. If Drouet only takes a small force, more allied troops may
be left in Estremadura; Zafra had better be their head-quarters. Hill
would conduct the marching column as far as Perales, and then return
to take charge of whatever is left in the South to watch Soult<a
id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>.</p>

<p>A few days later it became evident that no general movement of
the French towards the Tagus was in progress. Daricau’s infantry and
the attached cavalry settled down at and about Zalamea, and pushed
nothing but reconnaissances in the direction of the Guadiana—parties
of horse appeared about Don Benito and Medellin, but no solid
columns in support<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692"
class="fnanchor">[692]</a>. Hill therefore halted, with his
head-quarters at Zafra and his rearguard (which had but a moment before
been his advanced guard) at Llerena: only a few of J. Campbell’s
Portuguese squadrons moved to Merida, though some Spanish infantry
came up to the same direction<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693"
class="fnanchor">[693]</a>. Things then remained very quiet till July
24th, when Drouet at last appeared to be on the move with some definite
purpose. On that day Lallemand’s dragoons appeared at Hinojosa,
pressed in a Portuguese cavalry regiment, and seemed inclined to
push towards Ribera, but retired when Long’s brigade came up against
them: the losses on both sides were trifling. Three days later (July
27) a brigade of Daricau’s infantry advanced to Medellin and drove
off the observing force of the Spanish infantry, while Vinot’s<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[p. 535]</span> cavalry executed a raid
on Merida, expelled the Portuguese detachment there, and exacted a
requisition of food from the town. They then retired in haste; but
Hill thought it well for the future to strengthen his left, and moved
up Byng’s British and A. Campbell’s Portuguese infantry brigades to
Merida. But Drouet was only feinting, and had no serious intentions of
drawing up to the Guadiana, or crossing that river northward. His main
purpose was simply the raising of requisitions; for his detachments
in the mountains of the Serena were living on the edge of famine, and
could only feed themselves by keeping constantly on the move. It is
curious to find from the dispatches of the two opposing generals at
this time that both were fairly satisfied with themselves: each thought
that he was ‘containing’ a somewhat superior force of the enemy, and
was doing his duty by keeping it from interfering in the more important
theatre of war. Hill knew that he was detaining Drouet, when he was
much wanted at Madrid: Drouet knew that he was preventing Hill from
joining Wellington on the Douro. But the real balance of advantage was
on the side of the allies: Hill, with only 8,000 British and 11,000
Portuguese was claiming the attention of three veteran divisions of the
infantry of the Army of the South, and of the major part of Soult’s
cavalry. The French in Andalusia were left so weak by the absence of
18,000 men beyond the Sierra Morena, that they could neither molest
Cadiz nor the Army of Murcia. Indeed, Ballasteros, though his forces
were less than they had been at the time of his defeat at Bornos, was
able to provide employment for all the troops that Soult could spare
for operations in the open field.</p>

<p>Six weeks after his disaster of June 1st, that enterprising, if
irresponsible, general started out again from the lines of San Roque
with between 5,000 and 6,000 men. Keeping to mountain roads and
concealing his march, he surprised, on July 14, the great harbour-city
of Malaga, though he failed to capture its citadel, Gibalfaro, into
which the wrecks of the garrison escaped. Ballasteros got money,
stores, and recruits from the captured town, but knew that he dare
not tarry there for long. For Soult, naturally enraged at such a bold
and successful raid, turned troops toward him from all sides. Leval,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[p. 536]</span> governor of
Granada, marched against him with every spare battalion that could be
got together from the eastern side of Andalusia, some 5,000 bayonets.
Villatte, in command before Cadiz, came from the other quarter with
6,000 men; they had orders to catch Ballasteros between them, to
intercept his retreat upon Gibraltar, and annihilate him.</p>

<p>In order to cut off the Spaniard from his usual place of refuge,
Villatte took a turn to the south, appeared in sight of Gibraltar on
July 20, and then, keeping himself between the British fortress and
Ballasteros, advanced northward to wait for him. Leval was to have
driven him into Villatte’s arms, advancing from Antequera and pressing
the hunt southward. But the raider, instead of retreating in the
expected direction, slipped unseen across Villatte’s front by Alora,
and made off into the plains of central Andalusia. On the 25th at dawn
he appeared, most unexpectedly, at Osuna and surprised the small French
garrison there. The governor, Colonel Beauvais, cut his way through the
streets to a fortified convent, where he held out. But Ballasteros,
satisfied with having captured a quantity of stores, mules, and
baggage, and a few prisoners, vanished. Leval was on his track, and
he had to evade his pursuer by a flank march, first to Grazalema and
then to Ubrique. This was bringing him dangerously near to Villatte’s
position. But that general had no accurate knowledge of what was going
on to the north, and having waited for ten days in the mountains beyond
Gibraltar for a prey that never appeared, found himself starved out. On
the 30th he started on his enforced return towards the Cadiz Lines, and
had reached Medina Sidonia when Ballasteros, who had quite outmarched
Leval, came down in safety to Ximena on August 1, and placed himself
in touch with Gibraltar once more. Thereupon Leval, seeing that it
was no use to push the Spaniard (for about the tenth time) under the
guns of the British fortress, and finding his column utterly worn
out, went home to Granada<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694"
class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus Ballasteros gave no small help to the allied cause by
distracting some 11,000 or 12,000 French troops for a long fortnight,
while Hill was detaining Drouet in Estremadura. By the time that
the hunt after the evasive Spaniard had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_537">[p. 537]</span> come to an end, the battle of Salamanca
had been fought, and the aspect of affairs in the Peninsula had been
completely changed. Even Soult, who had so long shut his eyes to the
obvious, had at last to acknowledge that a new situation had arisen.</p>

<p>The news of Salamanca had reached Hill on July 29th, and caused a
general expectation that the French in Estremadura would retreat at
once, and that Soult would be retiring from Andalusia also in a few
days. No such results followed—the intelligence was late in penetrating
to the French camps; and Soult, still hoping to induce King Joseph to
join him, lingered for many days in his old posture. On August 4 Hill
wrote that the ‘recent glorious event’ appeared to have had very little
effect on his immediate opponent, who continued in a strong position
in his front. ‘Therefore for the present I shall remain where I am,
and watch for a favourable opportunity of acting<a id="FNanchor_695"
href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.’ Soult at Seville had,
as late as August 8, no official news of Marmont’s defeat, and only
knew of it by Spanish rumours, which he—of set purpose—discounted.
‘Les relations qu’ils ont publiées exagèrent sans doute les avantages:
mais il paraît que quelque grand événement s’est passé en Castille<a
id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>.’ He
continued to urge King Joseph to come to Seville, join him, and attack
Hill with such superior forces that Wellington would be forced to fly
to the aid of his subordinate. It was only on August 12th that certain
information regarding the battle of July 22nd reached the head-quarters
of the Duke of Dalmatia, in the form of Joseph’s Segovia dispatch
of July 29th, containing the orders for the complete evacuation of
Andalusia, and the march of the whole Army of the South upon Toledo.
Even then Soult did not think it too late to make a final appeal to the
King: ‘the loss of a battle by the Army of Portugal was nothing more
than a great duel, which can be undone by another similar duel. But the
loss of Andalusia and the raising of the siege of Cadiz would be events
whose effects would be felt all round Europe and the New World....
What does it matter if the enemy is left in possession of the whole
space between Burgos and the Sierra Morena, until the moment when<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[p. 538]</span> great reinforcements come
from France, and the Emperor has been able to make his arrangements?
But this sacrifice of Andalusia once made, there is no way of
remedying it. The imperial armies in Spain will have to repass the
Ebro—famine perhaps will drive them still farther<a id="FNanchor_697"
href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>On reflection, however, Soult did not venture to disobey, and,
before his last appeal could possibly have reached the King’s hands,
began to issue orders for evacuation. But so great was his rage
that he wrote an extraordinary letter to Clarke, the Minister of
War at Paris, in which he made the preposterous insinuation that
Joseph was about to betray his brother the Emperor, and to come to
an agreement with the Cadiz Cortes. The evidence which he cited
for this strange charge was flimsy in the extreme. ‘I have read in
the Cadiz newspapers the statement that His Majesty’s Ambassador
in Russia has joined the Russian army: that the King has opened
intrigues with the Insurrectional Government<a id="FNanchor_698"
href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. Sweden has made peace
with England, and the Hereditary Prince (Bernadotte) has begun to treat
with the Regency at Cadiz<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699"
class="fnanchor">[699]</a>.... I draw no deduction from all these
facts, but I am all the more attentive to them. I have thought it
necessary to lay my fears before six generals of my army, after having
made them take an oath not to reveal what I told them save to the
Emperor himself, or to some one specially commissioned by him. But
it is my duty to inform your Excellency that I have a fear that all
the bad arrangements made [by the King] and all the intrigues that
have been going on, have the object of forcing the imperial armies
to retreat to the Ebro, or farther, and then of representing this
event as the “last possible resource” (an expression used by the
King himself in a letter of July 20), in the hope of profiting by it
to come to some compromise<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700"
class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.</p>

<p>This letter, as obscurely worded as it was malicious, was not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[p. 539]</span> sent to France by the
usual channels, lest the King should get wind of it, but consigned to
the captain of a French privateer, who was about to sail from Malaga
to Marseilles. By an ill chance for Soult, the vessel was chased by
a British ship, and compelled to run for shelter into the harbour of
Valencia. There the King had recently arrived, on his retreat from
Madrid. The privateer-captain, who did not know what he was carrying,
sent the letter in to the royal head-quarters. Hence came an explosion
of wrath, and a series of recriminations with which we shall have to
deal in their proper place.</p>

<p>The evacuation of Andalusia commenced from the western end, because
the retreat of the army was to be directed eastwards. The evacuation
of the Castle of Niebla on August 12th was its first sign—the troops
in the Condado had retired to San Lucar near Seville by the 15th. A
little later the garrisons in the extreme south, at Ronda and Medina
Sidonia, blew up their fortifications and retired. These were small
movements, but the dismantling of the Cadiz Lines was a formidable
business, and took several days. Soult covered it by ordering a furious
bombardment of the city and the Puntales fort from his batteries across
the bay; during each salvo of the heavy guns one or two of them were
disabled, others being fired at an angle against their muzzles, so as
to split them. More were burst by intentional over-loading, others
had their trunnions knocked off, but a good many were only spiked or
thrown into the water. The ammunition remaining after two days of
reckless bombardment was blown up; the stores set on fire; the flotilla
of gunboats was sunk, but so carelessly that thirty of them were
afterwards raised with no difficulty and found still seaworthy. This
orgy of destruction continued for the whole of the 24th: at night the
sky was red all round the bay, from Rota to Chiclana, with burning huts
and magazines, and the explosions were frequent.</p>

<p>This was the moment when the large allied force in Cadiz might
well have made a general sortie, for the purpose of cutting up the
enemy while he was engrossed in the work of destruction. Wellington
had written a week before, to General Cooke, then in command of the
British contingent in the Isla de Leon, to bid him fall upon the enemy
when opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[p. 540]</span>
should offer, considering that the French troops in the Lines were
reduced to a minimum by the detachment of the division that had gone
out to hunt Ballasteros. He suggested that the allies should cross
the Santi Petri river and attack Chiclana, taking care, however, not
to be cut off from their retreat. Unfortunately this letter of August
16th came too late, for Cooke (after conferring with the Spanish
authorities) had committed himself to another and a more circuitous
expedition to molest the French. General Cruz Murgeon, with a Spanish
division of 4,000 men (which had originally been intended for the
reinforcing of Ballasteros) had landed at the port of Huelva, in the
Condado de Niebla, on August 11th. Cooke reinforced him with the pick
of the British contingent—six companies of Guards, half of the 2/87th<a
id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>,
two companies of Rifles<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702"
class="fnanchor">[702]</a>, part of the 20th Portuguese, and the
squadron of the 2nd Hussars K.G.L., which was the only cavalry at
his disposition. These, placed under the charge of Colonel Skerrett,
made up 1,600 men in all<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703"
class="fnanchor">[703]</a>; they landed at Huelva, joined Cruz Murgeon,
and advanced with him against Seville. On the 24th they discovered the
French outposts at San Lucar la Mayor, and drove them out of that town.
But they hesitated over the idea of attacking Seville, where French
troops were collecting from all quarters, though the divisions of
Conroux and Villatte from the Cadiz Lines had not yet come up.</p>

<p>On the night of August 26th-27th, however, Soult, apprised of the
near approach of his column from the Lines, evacuated Seville with the
main part of his force, escorting a vast horde of Spanish refugees,
who feared to remain behind to face their countrymen, and a long train
of wagons and carriages loaded with the accumulated spoils of three
years of tyrannous misrule in Andalusia. He left a rearguard to occupy
the outworks of the city, which was to be picked up and taken on by
Villatte when he should appear on the next day.</p>

<p>On hearing of the departure of the Marshal, Cruz Murgeon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[p. 541]</span> and Skerrett resolved to
attack Seville, knowing that the troops left behind to guard it were
insufficient to man effectively all its long line of defences. Being
on the western side of the Guadalquivir, they had first to win the
large transpontine suburb of Triana, the home of potters and gipsies,
through which alone access could be got to the city. It was attacked
at several points and stormed, but the enemy then held to the great
bridge over the river linking Triana and Seville, and made a long
resistance there. The bridge had been barricaded, part of its planks
had been pulled up, and artillery had been trained on it from the
farther side. Notwithstanding these obstacles the Spaniards attacked
it; the well-known Irish adventurer Colonel Downie charged three times
at the head of his Estremaduran Legion. Repelled twice by the heavy
fire, he reached the barricade at the third assault, and leaped his
horse over the cut which the French had made in front of it, but found
himself alone within the work, and was bayoneted and made prisoner<a
id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>.
But soon after the allies brought up guns through the streets of
Triana, and so battered the barricade that the French were compelled
to evacuate it. Skerrett sent the Guards across: they passed by
the beams which had been left unbroken, and many Spanish troops
followed. After a running fight in the streets of the city, in which
some of the inhabitants took part, the garrison was completely
driven out, and fled by the Carmona Gate towards Alcala. The victors
captured two field-pieces, about 200 prisoners<a id="FNanchor_705"
href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>, and a rich convoy of
plunder, which was to have been escorted by the French rearguard<a
id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.
Villatte’s column, approaching the city in its march from the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[p. 542]</span> Cadiz Lines and Xeres,
found it in the hands of the allies, so swerved off eastward and
followed Soult, picking up the expelled garrison by the way.</p>

<p>Cruz Murgeon and Skerrett did not pursue, not thinking themselves
strong enough to meddle with the French, but only sent their cavalry
forward to watch their retreat. They stayed in Seville, where the Cadiz
Constitution was proclaimed with great enthusiasm on August 29th. On
the other flank of the French Ballasteros was trying at this moment to
molest the column formed by the garrisons retiring from Ronda, Malaga,
and Antequera on Granada. He followed them for ten days, and fought
their rearguard at Antequera on September 3rd, and at Loja on September
5th; but though he captured many stragglers and some baggage, as also
three guns, he was unable to do any material harm to the main body,
which General Sémélé brought in to join Leval at Granada on September
6th.</p>

<p>Soult, meanwhile, with the troops from Cadiz and Seville, had to
halt at Cordova for some days, to allow of the junction of Drouet from
Estremadura; for that general had to collect his troops and to bring
down detachments from places so far away as Don Benito and Zalamea,
before he could concentrate and march across the Sierra Morena to
join his chief. Drouet had kept up a bold countenance in front of
Hill to the last moment, even after he had received orders from Soult
to prepare for a sudden retreat. Indeed one of the most lively of
the many cavalry affairs fought in Estremadura during the summer
of 1812 took place in August. On the 1st of that month, when Hill
was already expecting that the news of Salamanca would have driven
his opponent away, Pierre Soult tried a raid upon Ribera, with two
regiments of cavalry and two battalions, and drove in the 2nd Hussars
of the Legion, who maintained a long and gallant skirmishing fight,
till General Erskine came up with Long’s brigade, when the French
retreated. Erskine was thought to have missed a fine opportunity of
cutting up the raiding detachment by his slow and tentative pursuit<a
id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>.
On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[p. 543]</span> the 18th Soult
made another reconnaissance in force, with four regiments, in the
same direction, on a false report that Hill had moved from Ribera and
Almendralejo. This brought on another long day of bickering, with no
definite result: it was mainly remembered afterwards for the courteous
behaviour of Drouet in sending back unharmed Erskine’s aide-de-camp
Strenowitz, the most daring officer for raids and reconnaissance work
in the German Legion. He had been captured while scouting, and a
general fear prevailed that he would be shot, for he had served for
a short time in the French army, and might have been treated as a
deserter. Drouet most handsomely dispatched him to the British camp on
parole, with a request that he might be exchanged for an officer of
his own, who had been taken a few days before. ‘A most courteous and
liberal enemy!’ wrote a diarist in Hill’s camp, ‘Strenowitz’s exploits
are well known: certainly in strict law he might have been hung<a
id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>.’</p>

<p>It was not till August 26th that all the French troops in front of
Hill suddenly vanished, Drouet having had orders to keep his position
till Seville was ready to be evacuated; for Soult feared that if he
withdrew his forces in Estremadura too early, in the direction of
Cordova, the allied troops might make a forced march on Seville,
and arrive there before the divisions from the Cadiz Lines had gone
by. Wherefore Drouet was in evidence before Hill till the precise
day when Soult left Seville. He then retired through the Sierra
Morena, going by the remote mountain road by Belalcazar with such
speed that he reached Cordova on the fourth day (August 30). He was
not pursued by Hill, whose orders from Wellington were to come up
to the Tagus and join the main army, and not to involve himself in
operations in Andalusia. Only some of Penne Villemur’s Spanish horse,
under the German colonel Schepeler—one of the best historians of the
war—followed on Drouet’s track, and saw him join Soult at Cordova<a
id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[p. 544]</span> united
French force then marched on Granada, where the garrisons of eastern
Andalusia, under Leval, had concentrated to meet the Marshal. Up to
this moment Soult had been uncertain whether he should retreat by way
of La Mancha, or across the kingdom of Murcia. His decision was settled
for him by news brought by Drouet, who had heard in Estremadura of
King Joseph’s evacuation of Madrid and Toledo. Since the Army of the
Centre was now known to be on the road for Valencia, to join Suchet, it
would be too dangerous to cross La Mancha in search of it. Wellington
might descend from Madrid in force, upon an enemy who dared to march
across his front. Wherefore Soult resolved that his retreat must be
made across the kingdom of Murcia. It was true that O’Donnell’s army
was in occupation of the inland in that direction, but it was weak and
disorganized. Moreover, Suchet had lately inflicted a severe defeat
upon it at Castalla (on July 21st), and O’Donnell was practically a
negligible quantity in the problem. A far more important factor in
determining Soult’s exact route was the news that the yellow fever had
broken out at Cartagena and was spreading inland: it had reached the
city of Murcia. Wherefore the French army avoided the coast, and took
the inferior roads across the northern part of the province.</p>

<p>Soult, when once he had concentrated 45,000 men at Granada, had
nothing to fear from any enemy. The gloomy picture of ‘a retreat
harrassed by 60,000 foes,’ with which he had tried to scare King Joseph
a month before, turned out to be a work of pure imagination. Hill
had turned off towards the Tagus: Cruz Murgeon and Skerrett remained
at Seville, awaiting the appearance of the 10,000 men left in Cadiz.
But these were slow to move, because they had been on garrison duty
for long years, and had to provide themselves with transport. Only
Ballasteros hung about Granada, bickering with the outposts of the
French army, and as he had no more than 5,000 or 6,000 men he was not
dangerous, but only tiresome.</p>

<p>Soult therefore was able to spend many days at Granada, making
deliberate preparations for the toilsome march that was before him.
He only started out, after destroying the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_545">[p. 545]</span> fortifications of the Alhambra and other
posts, on September 16th. His route was by Baza, Huescar, Caravaca,
and Hellin, through a mountainous and thinly-peopled country, where
his troops suffered considerable privations. But these were nothing
compared to the misery of the immense convoy of <i>Afrancesados</i> of all
ages and both sexes, who had joined themselves to his train, and had
to be brought through to a place of safety. Nor did the 6,000 sick and
wounded whom he was dragging with him enjoy a pleasant journey. Yet it
was only the September heat and the mountain roads that harassed the
army and its train: Ballasteros did not pursue farther than the borders
of Andalusia: the Murcians were cowed by the approach of a force which
could have destroyed them with ease if it had lingered within their
borders. Some of them shifted north toward Madrid, others south toward
Alicante: none did anything to attract the notice of such a formidable
enemy. Touch with Suchet’s outposts was secured before September was
quite ended, and by the appearance of the whole Army of Andalusia
near Valencia, a new military situation was produced by October 1st.
With this we shall have to deal in its proper place—the fortunes of
Wellington and the main army of the allies have not been followed
beyond the middle of August.</p>

<p>Summing up the events of June-July-August 1812 in southern Spain, it
is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Soult’s personal interests
wrecked any chance that the French might have had of retaining their
dominant position in the Peninsula, when once Wellington had committed
himself to his offensive campaign upon the Tormes and the Douro. If
the Duke of Dalmatia had obeyed in June King Joseph’s peremptory
orders to send Drouet to Toledo, he would have had, no doubt, to
evacuate certain parts of Andalusia. But Joseph and Jourdan could have
marched many weeks earlier, and with a doubled force, to interfere
with Wellington’s campaign against Marmont. It is true that Hill
would have made a corresponding movement by Alcantara, and would have
joined the main allied army under his chief many days before the King
and Drouet would have been able to link up with Marmont. But Hill, on
leaving Estremadura, would have removed the larger and more efficient
part of his corps from Soult’s vicinity, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_546">[p. 546]</span> the Marshal might easily have held
Seville and the Cadiz Lines, when faced by no stronger enemies than
Ballasteros and the garrison in the Isla. If Soult had made up his mind
to sacrifice Andalusia, and had marched with his whole army on Toledo,
in June or even early in July, Wellington’s whole game would have been
wrecked. It was, perhaps, too much to expect that the Marshal would
consent to such a disinterested policy. But if, without making this
sacrifice, he had merely obeyed King Joseph, and reinforced the Army of
the Centre at an early date, he would have made the Salamanca campaign
impossible. Wellington would probably have retired behind the Agueda
and abandoned his conquests in Leon, without risking a battle, if the
French forces in contact with him had been 25,000 men stronger than
they actually were. The junction of Hill and some 12,000 men of the
best of his Estremaduran detachment would have given him the power to
fight out a defensive campaign on the Portuguese frontier, but hardly
to deliver an offensive battle like Salamanca. The net results of all
his manœuvres in June would then have been no more than an indirect
success—the delivery of eastern Andalusia from Soult. Seville and the
Cadiz Lines might still have remained occupied by the French.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to repeat once more that Soult’s
counter-plan of inviting the King and the Army of the Centre to
retire to Andalusia, throwing up all communication with France and
the imperial armies beyond the Douro, was wrongheaded in the extreme,
though Napier calls it ‘grand and vigorous<a id="FNanchor_710"
href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.’ Joseph could have
brought no more than the 15,000 men that he owned, and they, when
added to the 50,000 men of the Army of the South, would not have
provided a force large enough to make a decisive move. For, as we have
already seen, half the French in Andalusia were necessarily pinned
down to garrison duties, and the ‘containing’ of Ballasteros and other
partisans. Soult could never bring more than 25,000 men of his own
into Estremadura: if 15,000 more are added for King Joseph’s troops<a
id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>, only
40,000 in all would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[p.
547]</span> available for a demonstration (or a serious invasion) in
the direction of Portugal. Such a force would have given Wellington no
very great alarm. It would have had to begin by besieging Badajoz and
Elvas, in face of the existing ‘containing’ army under Hill, a delicate
business, and one that would have taken time. Meanwhile Wellington
could have come down, with reinforcements strong enough to make up
a total sufficient to fight and beat 40,000 men, since he had the
advantage of a central position and the shorter roads. At the worst
he would have blocked the French advance by taking up an unassailable
position, as he had before on the Caya in June 1811. But now he would
have had a far superior game in his hands, since Badajoz was his and
not his enemy’s, and his total disposable force was considerably larger
than it had been in 1811.</p>

<p>Thus, if Soult’s plan had been carried out, all central Spain,
including the capital, would have been lost just as much as it was by
the actual campaign of July-August 1812, and the disorganized Army of
Portugal could have done nothing. For Wellington could have left not
Clinton’s one division (as he actually did) but three at least to look
after it—not to speak of the Galicians and the <i>partidas</i>. Isolated and
cut off from all communication with other French armies, Soult and the
King would have had to evacuate Andalusia in the end, if they did not
suffer a worse fate—a crushing defeat in a position from which there
would have been no retreat possible. Hypothetical reconstructions of
campaigns which might have happened are proverbially futile—but it is
hard to see how any final profit to the French could have come from
Soult’s extraordinary plan.</p>

    SIR HOME POPHAM AND CAFFARELLI. (2) OPERATIONS
    IN THE EAST: SUCHET, O’DONNELL, AND MAITLAND.
    JUNE-AUGUST 1812</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It has</span> already been made clear that
the whole of Wellington’s victorious advance, from Ciudad Rodrigo to
Madrid, was rendered possible by the fact that he had only to deal
with the Army of Portugal, succoured when it was too late by the Army
of the Centre. If Caffarelli and his 35,000 men of the Army of the
North had been able to spare any help for Marmont, beyond the single
cavalry brigade of Chauvel, matters must have taken a very different
turn from the first, and the Douro (if not the Tormes) must have been
the limit of the activity of the Anglo-Portuguese army. How Caffarelli
was to be detained, according to Wellington’s plan, has been explained
in an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712"
class="fnanchor">[712]</a>. The working out of the scheme must now be
described.</p>

<p>The essential duty of the French Army of the North was twofold,
according to Napoleon’s general conception of the Spanish war. It was
Marmont’s reserve, bound to assist him in time of trouble; but it was
also the force of occupation for the Biscayan provinces, Navarre,
Santander, and Burgos. Of its 35,000 men more than half were at all
times immobilized in the innumerable garrisons which protected the
high-road from Bayonne to Burgos, and the small harbours of the coast,
from San Sebastian to Santoña. The system of posts was complicated
and interdependent. Since the great guerrillero Mina started on his
busy career in 1810, it had been necessary that there should be
fortified places at short intervals, in which convoys moving to or
from France (whether by Vittoria and San Sebastian, or by Pampeluna
and Roncesvalles) could take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[p.
549]</span> refuge when attacked by the bands. And since a convoy,
when it had sought shelter in one of the minor garrisons, might be
blockaded there indefinitely, unless the high-road were cleared
betimes, large movable columns had to be ready in three or four of the
larger places. Their duty was to march out on the first alarm, and
sweep the guerrilleros away from any post that they might have beset.
Such bodies were to be found at Bayonne, where the ‘Reserve of the
Army of Spain’ kept a brigade of 3,500 men under General D’Aussenac
to watch for any exceptional outbreak of trouble in Guipuzcoa; at
Pampeluna, where General Abbé had the head-quarters of his division;
and at Vittoria, where the General-in-Chief, Caffarelli himself,
normally lay with the brigade of Dumoustier—the last unit of the
Imperial Guard still remaining in Spain—ready to keep the line of the
Ebro under surveillance, and to communicate when necessary with the
three large outlying garrisons of Santoña, Santander, and Burgos. Each
of these last consisted of some 1,300 or 1,500 men<a id="FNanchor_713"
href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>; even so, they were
only strong enough to provide for their own safety in normal times, and
might require assistance from head-quarters in face of any specially
large and threatening combination of the insurgents. But the larger
half of Caffarelli’s army was locked up in small towns, forts, and
blockhouses, in bodies ranging down from a battalion to half a company.
Every one of the dozen little ports on the Biscay coast had to be
held, in order to prevent the bands of the inland from communicating
with the English cruisers, which occasionally appeared in the offing
to throw weapons and ammunition ashore. And similarly all the little
towns along the Ebro had to be garrisoned, in order to keep touch with
Reille at Saragossa; wherever there was a gap Mina’s Navarrese slipped
in between.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[p. 550]</span>Since the
autumn of 1810, when Porlier and Renovales had made their vain
attempt, with British naval aid, to break up the line of communication
along the coast,<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714"
class="fnanchor">[714]</a> there had been no general attempt to shake
the French occupation of Biscay and Cantabria. The Spanish resources
were at a low ebb whenever Bonnet held the Asturias, and (as we have
seen) he was generally in possession of that province, or at least of
its capital and its chief harbours, from 1810 down to the summer of
1812. The idea of attacking the harbour-fortresses of the northern
coast with a considerable naval force, which should get into regular
touch with the patriot forces of the inland, and establish posts to be
held permanently on suitable points of the northern littoral, had been
started by Sir Home Popham, approved by Sir Howard Douglas, the British
Commissioner in Galicia, and warmly adopted by Wellington himself, who
at once realized the pressure which such a policy would bring upon
Caffarelli. He counted upon this diversion as one of his most valuable
assets, when he drew up his scheme for the invasion of Leon in May
1812. It more than fulfilled his expectation.</p>

<p>On June 17th, four days after the Anglo-Portuguese army
crossed the Agueda, Sir Home Popham sailed from Corunna with two
line of battleships<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715"
class="fnanchor">[715]</a>, five frigates<a id="FNanchor_716"
href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>, two sloops<a
id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>,
and one or two smaller vessels, carrying two battalions of marines,
and several thousand stand of small-arms for the insurgents. Popham
had credentials from Castaños, as captain-general of Galicia, for
Mendizabal, the officer who was supposed to exercise authority over all
the bands of Cantabria and Biscay. These scattered forces consisted
in the more or less organized brigades of Porlier in the Eastern
Asturias, and Longa in Cantabria—both of which were reckoned part of
the national army—and in addition of the guerrilleros of Jauregui [’El
Pastor’] in Guipuzcoa, Renovales in Biscay, Marquinez, Saornil, the
Curé Merino, and others in the mountains between the Douro and the sea.
These were bands of varying strength, often scattered by the French,
but always reassembled after a space, who roamed from region to region
according as the enemy was stronger or weaker at one point or another.
Occasionally Mendizabal was in touch with Mina and the Navarrese,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[p. 551]</span> but generally the French
were in too great force about the high-road from Burgos to Pampeluna to
make co-operation practicable.</p>

<p>At the moment of Popham’s start matters were exceptionally
favourable along the Biscay coast, because Bonnet was just evacuating
the Asturias, in order to join his chief Marmont in the plains of Leon.
His departure isolated Santoña and Santander, which had been the links
by which he was joined to Caffarelli’s army. It also gave Porlier and
Longa an open communication with Galicia, from which they had hitherto
been cut off by Bonnet’s presence in Asturias, and a safe retreat
thitherward if they should be pressed. In addition Marmont had called
up all the small garrisons and detached columns from his rear, for
the main struggle with Wellington; so that the Upper Douro valley and
the Soria country were much more free from the French than they had
been for a long time. The opportunity for molesting Caffarelli and his
much-scattered Army of the North was unique.</p>

<p>The idea which lay at the back of Popham’s plan was that a fleet
furnished with the heaviest ship guns, and with a landing-force of
over 1,000 men, could operate at its choice against any one of the
long chain of posts which the French held, calling in to its aid the
local bands in each case. The insurgents had never been able to capture
any of these places because they lacked a battering-train. The fleet
supplied this want, and with few exceptions the French strongholds
were not suited for resistance against heavy guns. They were mediaeval
castles, fortified convents, or the patched-up walls of little towns,
all defensible against irregular bands without cannon, but most
vulnerable to 18-or 24-pounders. The number of the French garrisons
gave ample liberty of choice between one and another: individually
they were generally weak—not over 300, 500, or 1,000 men. There were
succouring columns, no doubt, ready to relieve them, at Bayonne and
Vittoria and elsewhere. But the squadron had the power of misleading
these forces to any extent—of drawing them from one remote port to
another by false attacks and demonstrations, and then of attacking
some third point when the enemy had been lured as far as possible
from it. Here lay the beauty of naval operations—the squadron<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[p. 552]</span> could appear to threaten
any objective that it chose, could attract the enemy thither, and then
could vanish, and be fifty miles away next day. The relieving column
could only follow slowly over mountain roads, and would invariably be
late in learning what new direction the squadron had taken. It was
something like the advantage that the Danes had in their attacks on
England in the ninth century: a defending army cannot guard all points
of a coast-line at once against a movable landing force on shipboard.
The weaker points of the scheme were, firstly, the dependence of all
operations on fine weather—contrary winds could in those days delay
a fleet for whole weeks on end; secondly, the want of a base nearer
than Corunna, till some good and defensible haven should have been
captured; and third and greatest of all, the difficulty of inducing the
local chiefs to combine: they paid a very limited amount of obedience
to their nominal chief, Mendizabal: they had private grievances and
jealousies against each other: and each of them disliked moving far
from the particular region where his men were raised, and where every
inch of the mountain roads was known to him.</p>

<p>However, all these dangers were known and were chanced, and
the game was well worth the risk. The operations began with the
appearance of the squadron before Lequeitio on June 21st. Popham
landed a heavy gun and some marines, and the band of El Pastor [’Don
Gaspar’ as the English dispatches call him] appeared to co-operate
from the inland. The defences consisted of a fort and a fortified
convent: the 24-pounder breached the former, which was then stormed
by the guerrilleros in a very handsome fashion<a id="FNanchor_718"
href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>: its garrison was slain
or captured. The gun was then brought up against the fortified convent,
whose commander, the <i>chef de bataillon</i> Gillort, surrendered without
further fighting; the prisoners amounted to 290 men, a half-battalion
of the 119th regiment (June 22). Popham then moved off to Bermeo and
Plencia, both of which the French evacuated in haste, leaving guns
unspiked and some useful stores of provisions. The British force had
set the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[p. 553]</span> wildest
rumours abroad, and Renovales, the Spanish commander in Biscay,
appeared at Orduna with his bands and threatened Bilbao, the capital of
the province. It was these reports which made Caffarelli suddenly break
off his project for sending reinforcements to Marmont, and prepare
rather to march northward when he was most wanted on the Douro<a
id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>.</p>

<p>Popham’s next blow was at Guetaria, a most important post, owing to
its nearness to the great <i>chaussée</i> leading to Bayonne, which passes
quite close to it between Tolosa and Ernani. If it had fallen, the main
road from France to Spain would have been blocked for all practical
purposes. But being far to the East and near the French border, it was
remote from the haunts of the guerrilleros: few of them turned up:
after a few days Popham had to re-embark guns and men, and to take his
departure, owing to the arrival in his neighbourhood of a strong French
flying column. He then sailed off to Castro Urdiales, where he had much
better luck: Longa had left the Upper Ebro with his brigade and joined
him there on July 6th, by Mendizabal’s orders. Their united force drove
off on the 7th a small French column which came up from Laredo to raise
the siege. The governor of Castro then surrendered with some 150 men,
and 20 guns on his walls fell into Popham’s hands (July 8). The place
seemed so strong that the commodore resolved to keep it as a temporary
base, and garrisoned it with some of his marines.</p>

<p>Three days later Popham appeared before Portugalete, the fortified
village at the mouth of the Bilbao river, and bombarded it from the
side of the sea, while Longa (who had marched parallel with the
squadron along the shore), demonstrated against its rear. But a French
flying column happened just to have arrived at Bilbao, and the force
which marched out against the assailants was so powerful that they
made off, each on his own element [July 11th.] Popham now turned his
attention for a second time to the important strategical post of
Guetaria; he had enlisted the support of the Guipuzcoan bands under
Jauregui, and the distant Mina had promised to send a battalion to his
aid from Navarre. Popham got heavy guns on shore, and began to batter
the place, while Jauregui<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[p.
554]</span> blockaded it on the land side. This move drew the attention
of D’Aussenac, commanding the flying column which belonged to the
Bayonne reserve: he marched with 3,000 men towards Guetaria, and
drove off Jauregui, whereupon Popham had to re-embark in haste, and
lost two guns which could not be got off in time and thirty men [July
19], Mina’s battalion came up a day too late to help the discomfited
besiegers.</p>

<p>This petty disaster was in the end more favourable than harmful
to Popham’s general plan, for he had succeeded in drawing all
the attention of the French to the eastern end of their chain of
coast-fortresses, between Santoña and San Sebastian. But now he used
his power of rapid movement to attack unexpectedly their most important
western stronghold. On July 22nd he appeared in front of the harbour of
Santander, while (by previous arrangement) Campillo—one of Porlier’s
lieutenants—invested it on the land side. Porlier himself, with his
main body, was blockading at the moment the not very distant and still
stronger Santoña.</p>

<p>There was very heavy fighting round Santander between the 22nd July
and August 2. Popham landed guns on the water-girt rock of Mouro, and
bombarded from it the castle at the mouth of the port: when its fire
was subdued, he ran his squadron in battle order past it, and entered
the harbour, receiving little damage from the other French works (July
24). The enemy then evacuated the castle, which the marines occupied:
but an attempt to storm the town with the aid of Campillo’s men
failed, with a rather heavy casualty list of two British captains<a
id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
and many marines and seamen disabled (July 27th). However, Popham
and Campillo held on in front of Santander, and Mendizabal came up
on August 2nd to join them, bringing a captured French dispatch,
which proved that the enemy intended to evacuate the place, a strong
relieving column under Caffarelli himself being at hand to bring
off the garrison. And this indeed happened: the General-in-Chief of
the Army of the North had marched with all the disposable troops at
Vittoria to save his detachment. The governor Dubreton—the same man
who afterwards defended Burgos so well—broke out of the place with
his 1,600 men on the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[p.
555]</span> of the 2nd-3rd and joined his chief in safety: he left
eighteen guns spiked in his works. Caffarelli then drew off the
garrison of the neighbouring small post of Torrelavega, but threw a
convoy and some reinforcements into Santoña, which he had determined
to hold as long as possible. He then hastened back to Vittoria, being
under the impression at the moment that Wellington was in march against
him from Valladolid, in pursuit of the routed host of Clausel. But the
Anglo-Portuguese main army—as will be remembered—had really followed
the retreating French no farther than Valladolid, and no longer than
the 30th July. Instead of finding himself involved in the affairs of
the Army of Portugal, Caffarelli had soon another problem in hand.</p>

<p>The capture of Santander by the allies was the most important event
that had happened on the north coast of Spain since 1809, for it gave
the squadron of Popham possession of the sole really good harbor—open
to the largest ships, and safe at all times of the year—which lies
between Ferrol and the French frontier. At last the Spanish ‘Seventh
Army’ had a base behind it, and a free communication with England for
the stores and munitions that it so much needed. It might be developed
into a formidable force if so strengthened, and it lay in a position
most inconvenient for the French, directly in the rear of Clausel and
Caffarelli. Popham saw what might be made of Santander, and drew up
for Wellington’s benefit a report on the possibilities of the harbour,
in which he details, from the information given by Porlier and his
staff, the state of the roads between it and Burgos, Valladolid, and
other points. Six weeks before the siege of Burgos began, he wrote
that by all accounts six or eight heavy guns would be required to
take that fortress, and that he could manage that they should be got
there—a distance of 115 miles—by ox-draught, if they were wanted<a
id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.
But Wellington, at the moment that this<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_556">[p. 556]</span> useful information was being compiled,
was turning away from Valladolid and Burgos toward Madrid; and when
his attention was once more drawn back to Burgos, he made no use of
Popham’s offers till it was too late. Of this more in its proper
place.</p>

<p>Having brought all his squadron into Santander, and made himself a
fixed base in addition to his floating one, Popham began to concert
plans for further operations with Mendizabal, whom he described as
a man of ‘vacillating councils,’ and hard to screw up to any fixed
resolution. The scheme which the commodore most recommended to the
general was one for a general concentration of all his scattered forces
against Bilbao, in which the squadron should give its best help. But
he suggested as an alternative the sending of Porlier to join Longa,
who had already gone south to the Upper Ebro after the failure at
Portugalete on July 11th. Porlier and Longa would together be strong
enough to cut the road between Burgos and Vittoria, and so divide
Clausel from Caffarelli. If the two French generals combined against
them, they could always escape north-westward into their usual mountain
refuges.</p>

<p>According to Popham’s notes Mendizabal first seemed to incline to
the second scheme, and then decided for the first. He even in the end
ordered up Longa—then very usefully employed against Clausel’s rear
about Pancorbo and Cubo—to join in the attack upon Bilbao. But Longa
came late, being busy in operations that he liked better than those
which his chief imposed on him. After waiting a few days for him in
vain, Mendizabal marched against Bilbao by land with two battalions
belonging to Porlier and one recently raised in Alava, while Popham
took three Biscayan battalions belonging to Renovales on board his
squadron and sailed for Lequeitio, where he put them ashore. He himself
then made for Portugalete, at the mouth of the Bilbao river. The triple
attack, though made with no very great total force was successful.
The officer commanding in Bilbao, went out to meet Mendizabal, and
in order to collect as many men as possible, drew off the garrison
of Portugalete. The British squadron, arriving in front of the port,
found it undefended and threw the marines ashore.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_557">[p. 557]</span> Hearing of this descent in his rear
the French general, then indecisively engaged with Mendizabal and
Renovales, thought that he was in danger of being surrounded, and
retired hastily toward Durango, abandoning Bilbao altogether [August
13].</p>

<p>Learning next day that they had overrated the enemy’s force, the
French returned and tried to reoccupy the Biscayan capital, but were
met outside by all Mendizabal’s troops, arrayed on the position of
Ollorgan. An attack entirely failed to move them, and the French
fell back to Durango. General Rouget, the commanding officer in the
province, then drew in all his minor garrisons, and sent Caffarelli
notice that all Biscay was lost, unless something could be done at
once to check Mendizabal’s progress [August 14]. Indeed the situation
looked most threatening, for Longa had at last come up and joined his
chief with 3,000 men, and the Biscayans were taking arms on every side.
A general junta of the Basque provinces was summoned by Mendizabal to
meet at Bilbao, and the French had for the moment no foothold left save
in San Sebastian and Guetaria. Thereupon Caffarelli, collecting every
man that he could at Vittoria, marched to join Rouget. Their united
forces, making some 7,000 men, attacked Bilbao on August 27th-29th,
and after much confused fighting drove Mendizabal and Longa out of
the place, only a fortnight after it had come into Spanish hands. The
defeated troops dispersed in all directions, each section seeking the
region that it had come from—Porlier’s men retired towards Cantabria,
Longa’s toward the Upper Ebro. Renovales and his Biscayan battalions
were caught in their retreat, and badly cut up at Dima.</p>

<p>While this fighting was going on around Bilbao, Popham was trying
a last attack on Guetaria, with his own resources only, as nearly all
the Spaniards were engaged elsewhere. He had accomplished nothing
decisive when he heard of Mendizabal’s defeat, and had to reship his
guns and take his departure before the victorious Caffarelli came up.
He retired to Santander, and heard there that Wellington was leaving
Madrid, and once more marching on Burgos. He determined to open up
communications with the British army without delay, and on August 31
sent off Lieutenant Macfarlane to seek for the head of the approaching
columns. That officer, skirting the flank of Clausel’s retreating<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[p. 558]</span> host, reached Valladolid
betimes, and explained to Wellington that the Santander road would be
open and available for the transport of ammunition, guns, and even
food, so soon as he should have driven the French past Burgos. And—as
will be seen—it was so used during the unlucky siege of that fortress
again and again—but not (as Popham recommended) for the bringing up of
the heavy artillery that Wellington so much lacked.</p>

<p>By September 1st Caffarelli had patched up matters for a time on
the side of Biscay, but though he had recovered Bilbao and preserved
Guetaria, all the other coast-towns were out of his power save Santoña,
and that important place was cut off from the nearest French garrison
by a gap of some sixty miles. Even now Popham’s useful diversion had
not ceased to have its effect. But its further working belongs to a
later chapter.</p>

<p>So much for the annals of the war in northern Spain from June
to August. The diversion which Wellington had planned had been
brilliantly successful. A very different story must be told of the
equally important scheme that he had concerted for keeping his enemies
distracted on the eastern side of the Peninsula, by means of the
Anglo-Sicilian expedition and the Spanish Army of Murcia.</p>

<p>Suchet, it will be remembered<a id="FNanchor_722"
href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>, had been stayed from
further conquests after the fall of Valencia partly by the indirect
results of Wellington’s operations on the Portuguese frontier—starting
with the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo—partly by Napoleon’s action in drawing
back to the Ebro the two divisions of Reille, and calling out of
Spain the numerous Polish battalions serving in the Army of Aragon.
But not the least of the hindering causes was a purely personal
one—the long illness which kept Suchet confined to his bed for ten
weeks in February, March, and April. By the time that he was in the
saddle again a notable change had come over the aspect of the war
all over the Peninsula. During his sickness his lieutenants, Habert
and Harispe, maintained their position in front of the Xucar river,
and observed the wrecks of the Valencian and Murcian divisions
that had escaped from Blake’s disaster in January. The whole<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[p. 559]</span> force remaining under
Suchet—excluding the troops left behind in Catalonia and Aragon—was
not above 15,000 men, and of these nearly 4,000 were locked up in
garrisons, at Valencia, Saguntum, Peniscola, Morella, and other
places. It is not surprising, therefore, that no farther advance
was made against the Spaniards. Joseph O’Donnell, the successor of
the unlucky Mahy, was able during the spring to reorganize some
12,000 men on the <i>cadres</i> of his old battalions. In addition he
had Roche’s reserve at Alicante, 4,000 strong, which had now been
profiting for many months by the British subsidy and training, and
was reckoned a solid corps. He had also Bassecourt’s few battalions
in the inland—the troops that D’Armagnac had hunted in December
and January in the district about Requeña<a id="FNanchor_723"
href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>. Cartagena, the only
fortress on the coast still in Spanish hands save Alicante, had been
strengthened by the arrival of a British detachment<a id="FNanchor_724"
href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. Altogether there
were some 20,000 enemies facing Suchet in April, and he regarded it
as impossible to think of attacking Alicante, since he had not nearly
enough men in hand to besiege a place of considerable size, and at
the same time to provide a sufficient covering army against Joseph
O’Donnell. So little was the Murcian army molested that General Freire,
O’Donnell’s second-in-command, ignoring Suchet altogether, took
advantage of Soult’s absence in Estremadura, at the time of the fall of
Badajoz, to alarm eastern Andalusia. He occupied Baza on April 18th,
and when driven away after a time by Leval, governor of Granada, turned
instead against the coast-land of the South. On May 11th an expedition,
aided by English war-ships from Alicante, landed near Almeria, and
cleared out all the French garrisons from the small towns and shore
batteries as far west as Almunecar. Already before this (on May 1-3)
an English squadron had made a descent on Malaga, seized and destroyed
the harbour-works, and carried off some privateers and merchant vessels
from the port. But naught could be accomplished against the citadel of
Gibalfaro. Soult did little or nothing to resent these insults, because
he was at the time obsessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[p.
560]</span> with his ever-recurring idea that Wellington was about to
invade Andalusia, and his attention was entirely taken up with the
movements of Hill and Ballasteros in the West and North, so that the
East was neglected. Leval at Granada had a troublesome time, but was
in no real danger, since Freire’s raids were executed with a trifling
force.</p>

<p>Suchet was occupied at this time more with civil than with military
affairs: for some time after his convalescence he was engaged in
rearranging the administration of the kingdom of Valencia, and in
raising the enormous war-contribution which Napoleon had directed him
to exact—200,000,000 reals, or £2,800,000—in addition to the ordinary
taxes. The Marshal in his <i>Mémoires</i> gives a most self-laudatory
account of his rule; according to his rose-coloured narrative<a
id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>,
the imposts were raised with wisdom and benevolence, the population
became contented and even loyal, the roads were safe, and material
prosperity commenced at once to revive. Napier has reproduced most of
Suchet’s testimonials to his own wisdom and integrity, without any hint
that the Spanish version of the story is different. The Marshal who
drove the civil population of Lerida under the fire of the cannon<a
id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>,
and who signalized his entry into Valencia by wholesale executions of
combatants and non-combatants<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727"
class="fnanchor">[727]</a>, was not the benevolent being of his own
legend. Since that legend has been republished in many a later volume,
it may be well to give as a fair balance the version of an enemy—not of
a Spaniard, but of a Prussian, that Colonel Schepeler whose authority
on the war of Valencia we have so often had occasion to quote.</p>

<p>‘Napoleon Bonaparte looked upon Valencia as the prey of France,
and Suchet did not fall behind in his oppressive high-handedness. The
long-desired goal, the wealthy city, now lay open to their rapacity,
and the riches that the clergy had denied to the needs of the nation
went to fill the plunder-bag of the conqueror. The miraculous statue
of Our Lady of Pity was stripped of her ancient jewelled robe: only
a light mantle now draped her, and showed the cut of the nineteenth
century. The silver apostles of the cathedral took their way to
France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[p. 561]</span> with many
other objects of value, and the Chapter was forced to pay ransom for
hidden treasures. The magnanimous marshal imposed on the new French
province, as a sort of “benevolence,” six million dollars (ten had
been spoken of at first), with an additional million for the city of
Valencia. The churches had to buy off their bells with another 60,000
dollars. Suchet, in his moderation, contented himself with exacting 500
dollars a day for his own table and household expenses.</p>

<p>‘Political persecution began with a decree of March 11, which
ordered the judges of the local <i>Audiencia</i> [Law Court] to meet as
before, but to administer justice in the name of Napoleon <i>Empereur et
Roi</i>. The patriots refused to serve and fled; whereupon their goods
were confiscated, their families were harried, and when some of them
were captured they were threatened with penal servitude or death. A
decree drawn up in words of cold ferocity, declared every Spaniard
who continued to oppose the French to be a rebel and a brigand, and
therefore condemned to capital punishment. Several villages were
punished with fire and sword, because they were too patriotic to
arrest and deliver up insurgents. Contrary to the promise made at
the capitulation in January<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728"
class="fnanchor">[728]</a>, many patriots were arrested and executed,
under the pretence that they had been concerned in the murder of
Frenchmen in 1808, even though they might actually have saved the lives
of certain of those unfortunates at that time.</p>

<p>‘Valencia produces little wheat: there was much lack of it, and the
French would not accept rice. Their requisitions were exacted with
cruel disregard of consequences, even from the poorest, and quickly
brought back to the patriotic side the mutable Valencian people, who
had already been sufficiently embittered when they found that they
were annexed to France. All over the province there began to appear
slaughter, rebellion, and finally guerrillero bands<a id="FNanchor_729"
href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>.’</p>

<p>The point which Schepeler makes as to Valencia being practically
annexed to France—as shown by the administration of justice in the
name of Napoleon, not of King Joseph—should be noted. It illustrates
Suchet’s determination to consider himself as a French viceroy, rather
than as the general of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[p.
562]</span> of the armies recently placed by the Emperor under the
King as Commander-in-Chief in the Peninsula. We have already noted
the way in which he contrived to plead special orders from Paris,
exempting him from the royal control, whenever Joseph tried to borrow
some of his troops for use against Wellington<a id="FNanchor_730"
href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>. At the same time it
must be conceded that he had a much better excuse than Soult for his
persistent disobedience to such orders—his whole available force was
so small, that if he had sent 6,000 men to San Clemente or Ocaña,
as Joseph directed, there would have been little or nothing left in
Valencia save the garrisons, and the Spaniards from Alicante and Murcia
could have taken their revenge for the disasters of the past winter<a
id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>. He
represented to the King that to draw off such a body of troops to La
Mancha implied the abandonment of all his recent conquests, and that
if something had to be evacuated, it was better that Soult should
begin the process, since Andalusia was a more outlying possession than
Valencia—’les provinces du sud devaient être évacuées avant celles de
l’est.’ And here he was no doubt right: as we have been remarking again
and again, the only solution for the situation created by Wellington’s
successes was to concentrate a great mass of troops at all costs, and
the Army of the South could best provide that mass. It had 50,000
men under arms at the moment—Suchet had not in Valencia more than
15,000.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have spoken of those parts of the east coast of Spain
which lie south of the Ebro. But if the situation in Valencia had not
altered much between February and June, the same was also the case
in Catalonia. Since Eroles’s victory over Bourke at Roda in March<a
id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> there
had been much marching and counter-marching in that principality, but
nothing decisive. Lacy, the unpopular captain-general, was at odds
with the Junta, and especially with Eroles, the best of his divisional
officers, who was the most influential man in Catalonia, owing to his
local connexions and his untiring energy. Lacy was a stranger, an
enemy of the ‘Somaten’ system, and a pronounced Liberal. The political
tendencies of the Catalans were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[p.
563]</span> distinctly favourable to the other or ‘Servile’ party.
The captain-general was also accused of nourishing jealousy against
Sarsfield, his second-in-command: and it is certain that both that
officer and Eroles believed him capable of any mean trick toward them.
But though divided counsels and mutual suspicions often hindered the
co-operation of the commanders and the people, all were equally bitter
enemies of the invader, and none of them showed any signs of slackening
in their grim resolve to hold out to the end. The Catalan army did
not now count more than 8,000 men in the field, but its central
position in the mountains of the interior, round which the French
garrisons were dispersed in a long semicircle, gave it advantages that
compensated to a certain extent for its lack of numbers. It could
strike out at any isolated point on the circumference, and, whether
its blow failed or succeeded, generally got off before the enemy had
concentrated in sufficient numbers to do it much harm. On the other
hand, Decaen, now commanding in Catalonia, and Maurice Mathieu, the
governor of Barcelona, though they had some three times as many men
under arms as Lacy, were reduced to a position that was little more
than defensive. It is true that they occasionally collected a heavy
column and struck into the inland: but the enemy avoided them, and
replied by counter-attacks on depleted sections of the French circle
of garrisons. On April 9th, for example, 4,800 men marched from Gerona
against Olot: the local levies under Claros and Rovira skirmished with
them, giving ground, and finally losing the town. But though they did
not stop the advance of the enemy, Milans, with a larger force, moved
on the important harbour of Mataro, and laid siege to the garrison
there (April 22), a stroke which soon brought the bulk of French
troops back from Olot to drive him off. At the same time Sarsfield’s
division pressed in upon the garrison of Tarragona, and cut off its
communications with Barcelona.</p>

<p>This forced Decaen to march to open the road, with all the men that
Maurice Mathieu could spare from Barcelona (April 28). Letting them go
by, Lacy at once renewed the attack on Mataro, bringing up the forces
of Sarsfield and Milans, and borrowing four ship-guns from Commodore
Codrington to batter the fort, in which the French had taken refuge
after evacuating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[p. 564]</span>
the town [May 3]. Decaen and Lamarque promptly turned back, and on
the third day of the siege came hastily to break it up. The Spaniards
dispersed in various directions, after burying the guns, which (much
to Codrington’s regret) were discovered and exhumed by the enemy. The
net result of all this marching and counter-marching was that much
shoe-leather had been worn out, and a few hundred men killed or wounded
on each side: but certainly no progress had been made in the conquest
of Catalonia. Indeed, Manso, at the end of the campaign, established
himself at Molins de Rey, quite close to Barcelona, and Sarsfield
occupied Montserrat, so that between them they once more cut off the
communications from Barcelona southward and westward. Both had to be
driven off in June, in order that the roads might again be opened.</p>

<p>Early in July Lacy devised a scheme which made him more hated
than ever in Catalonia. He concerted with some Spanish employés in
the French commissariat service a plan for blowing up the powder
magazine of the great fortress of Lerida, and arranged to be outside
its walls on the day fixed for the explosion, and to storm it during
the confusion that would follow. Eroles and Sarsfield both protested,
pointing out that a whole quarter of the city must be destroyed, with
great loss of life. Lacy replied that the results would justify the
sacrifice, persisted in his scheme, and moved with every available
man towards Lerida to be ready on the appointed day. He miscalculated
his hours, however; and, though he left hundreds of stragglers behind
from over-marching, his column arrived too late. The explosion took
place on the 16th, with dreadful success; not only did a hundred of the
garrison perish, but a much larger number of the citizens; many houses
and one of the bastions fell. The governor Henriod, a very firm-handed
man whose record in Lerida was most tyrannical<a id="FNanchor_733"
href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>, had been entirely
unaware of the approach of the Spaniards, but proved equal to the
occasion. He put his garrison under arms, manned the breach, and showed
such a firm front, when Lacy appeared, that the captain-general,
having tired troops and no cannon, refused to attempt the storm. He
went off as quickly as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[p.
565]</span> had come, having caused the death of several hundred of
his countrymen with no profit whatever. If he was ready to adopt such
terrible means, he should at least have had his plans correctly timed.
The Catalans never forgave him the useless atrocity<a id="FNanchor_734"
href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>.</p>

<p>Operations in Catalonia and Valencia were thus dragging on with no
great profit to one side or the other, when Wellington’s great scheme
for the Anglo-Sicilian diversion on the east coast began at last to
work, and—as he had expected—set a new face to affairs. Unfortunately
the expedition was conducted very differently from his desire. We
have already shown how, by Lord William Bentinck’s perversity, it
started too late, and was far weaker than was originally intended<a
id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>.
But on July 15th General Maitland arrived at Port Mahon with a fleet
carrying three English<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736"
class="fnanchor">[736]</a> and two German battalions, and parts of
three foreign regiments, with a handful of cavalry, and two companies
of artillery. He sent messengers across Spain to announce to Wellington
his arrival, and his purpose of landing in Catalonia, as had been
directed. At Majorca he picked up Whittingham’s newly-organized
Balearic division, and after some delay he set sail on July 28 for
Palamos, a central point on the Catalan coast, off which he arrived on
the morning of July 31st with over 10,000 men on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[p. 566]</span>Owing to
Bentinck’s unhappy hesitation in May and June, after the expedition
had been announced and the troops ordered to prepare for embarkation,
French spies in Sicily had found the time to send warning to Paris,
and Suchet had been advised by the Minister of War that a fleet from
Palermo might appear in his neighbourhood at any moment. He received
his warning in the end of June, a month before Maitland’s arrival<a
id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>, and
this turned out in the end profitable to the allied cause; for, though
the fleet never appeared, he was always expecting it, and used the
argument that he was about to be attacked by an English force as his
most effective reply to King Joseph’s constant demands for assistance
in New Castile. The arrival at Alicante of transports intended to
carry Roche’s division to Catalonia, and of some vessels bearing the
battering-train which Wellington had sent round for Bentinck’s use,
was duly reported to him: for some time he took this flotilla to be
the Anglo-Sicilian squadron. Hence he was expecting all through June
and July the attack which (through Bentinck’s perversity) was never
delivered. The threat proved as effective as the actual descent might
have been, and Wellington would have been much relieved if only he
could have seen a few of Suchet’s many letters refusing to move a
man to support the King<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738"
class="fnanchor">[738]</a>.</p>

<p>Suchet’s great trouble was that he could not tell in the least
whether the Sicilian expedition would land in Catalonia or in Valencia.
It might come ashore anywhere between Alicante and Rosas. He prepared
a small movable central reserve, with which he could march northward
if the blow should fall between Valencia and Tortosa, or southward—to
reinforce Habert and Harispe—if it should be struck in the South.
Decaen was warned to have a strong force concentrated in central
Catalonia, in case the descent came in his direction, and Suchet
promised him such assistance as he could spare. On a rumour that the
Sicilian fleet had turned northward—as a matter of fact it was not
yet in Spanish waters—the Marshal thought it worth while to make a
rapid visit to Catalonia, to concert matters with Decaen. He marched
by Tortosa with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[p. 567]</span> a
flying column, and on July 10th met Decaen at Reus. Here he learned
that there were no signs of the enemy to be discovered, and after
visiting Tarragona, inspecting its fortifications, and reinforcing its
garrison, returned southward in a more leisurely fashion than he had
gone forth.</p>

<p>During Suchet’s absence from his Valencian viceroyalty the
captain-general of Murcia took measures which brought about one of
the most needless and gratuitous disasters that ever befell the
ever-unlucky army of which he was in charge. Joseph O’Donnell knew
that the Sicilian expedition was due, and he had been warned that
Roche’s division would be taken off to join it; he was aware that
Maitland’s arrival would modify all Suchet’s arrangements, and would
force him to draw troops away from his own front. He had been requested
by Wellington to content himself with ‘containing’ the French force
in his front, and to risk nothing. But on July 18th he marched out
from his positions in front of Alicante with the design of surprising
General Harispe. He knew that Suchet had gone north, and was not aware
of his return; and he had been informed, quite truly, that Harispe’s
cantonments were much scattered. Unfortunately he was as incapable as
he was presumptuous, and he entirely lacked the fiery determination of
his brother Henry, the hero of La Bispal. According to contemporary
critics he was set, at this moment, on making what he thought would
be a brilliant descent on an unprepared enemy, without any reference
to his orders or to the general state of the war<a id="FNanchor_739"
href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>. And he wished to fight
before Roche’s troops were taken from him, as they must soon be.</p>

<p>Harispe had only some 5,000 men—his own division, with one stray
battalion belonging to Habert<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740"
class="fnanchor">[740]</a>, and Delort’s cavalry brigade<a
id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>.
He had one infantry regiment in reserve at Alcoy<a id="FNanchor_742"
href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>, another at Ibi<a
id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>,
the third<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744"
class="fnanchor">[744]</a>—with the bulk of Delort’s horsemen—in
and about Castalla, the nearest point in the French cantonments to
Alicante. O’Donnell’s ambitious plan was to surround the troops in
Castalla and Ibi by a concentric movement of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_568">[p. 568]</span> several columns marching far apart, and
to destroy them before Harispe himself could come up with his reserve
from the rear. Bassecourt and his detachment from the northern hills
was ordered to fall in at the same time on Alcoy, so as to distract
Harispe and keep him engaged—a doubtful expedient since he lay many
marches away, and it was obvious that the timing of his diversion would
probably miscarry.</p>

<p>O’Donnell marched in three masses: on the right Roche’s division
went by Xixona with the order to surprise the French troops in Ibi.
The main body, three weak infantry brigades under Montijo, Mijares,
and Michelena, with two squadrons of cavalry and a battery, moved
straight upon Castalla. The main body of the horse, about 800 strong,
under General Santesteban, went out on the left on the side of Villena,
with orders to outflank the enemy and try to cut in upon his rear.
The whole force made up 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, not taking
into account the possible (but unlikely) advent of Bassecourt, so that
Harispe was outnumbered by much more than two to one. As an extra
precaution all the transports ready in Alicante were sent out—with
only one battalion on board—along the coast, to demonstrate opposite
Denia and the mouth of the Xucar, in order to call off the attention of
Habert’s division, which lay in that direction.</p>

<p>Having marched all night on the 20th July, the Spanish columns
found themselves—in a very fatigued condition—in front of the enemy at
four o’clock on the morning of the 21st. They were out of touch with
each other, Roche being separated from the centre by the mountain-spur
called the Sierra de Cata, and the cavalry having been sent very far
out on the flank. General Mesclop was opposed to Roche at Ibi, with
four battalions and a squadron of cuirassiers—General Delort, at
Castalla, had only one squadron of the cuirassiers, two battalions, and
a battery, but was expecting the arrival of the 24th Dragoons from the
neighbouring town of Biar, some way to his right, and of the remaining
two squadrons of the 13th Cuirassiers from Onil on his left. Meanwhile
he evacuated Castalla, but took up a position on a hillside covered by
a stream and a ravine crossed by a narrow bridge, with his trifling
force. He had already sent orders to Mesclop at Ibi to come in to
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[p. 569]</span> aid, leaving
only a rearguard to hold off as long as possible the Spanish column in
front of him. The latter did as he was bid; he threw into the Castle
of Ibi a company of the 44th and two guns, and left the rest of that
battalion and a troop of cuirassiers to support them. With the rest
of his force, the three battalions of the 1st Léger and the remaining
troop of cuirassiers, he set off in haste for Castalla.</p>

<p>O’Donnell assailed Delort in a very leisurely way after occupying
the town of Castalla—his troops were tired, and four of his six guns
had fallen behind. But Montijo’s brigade and the two pieces which had
kept up with it were developing an attack on the bridge, and Michelena
and Mijares had passed the ravine higher up, when the French detached
troops began to appear from all directions. The first to get up were
the 400 men of the 24th Dragoons, who—screened by an olive wood—came
in with a tremendous impact, and quite unforeseen, upon Mijares’s
flank, and completely broke up his three battalions. They then, after
re-forming their ranks, formed in column and charged across the narrow
bridge in front of O’Donnell’s centre, though it was commanded by
his two guns. An attack delivered across such a defile, passable by
only two horses abreast, looked like madness—but was successful! The
guns only fired one round each before they were ridden over, and the
brigade supporting them broke up. Delort then attacked, with his two
battalions and with the cuirassiers who had just come up from Onil.
Montijo’s brigade, the only intact Spanish unit left, was thus driven
from the field and scattered. The 6,000 infantry of O’Donnell’s centre
became a mass of fugitives—only one regiment out of the whole<a
id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
kept its ranks and went off in decent order. Of the rest nearly half
were hunted down and captured in droves by the French cuirassiers
and dragoons. Mesclop with the three battalions from Ibi arrived too
late to take any part in the rout. Delort sent him back at once to
relieve the detachment that he had left in front of Roche. The latter
had driven it out of the village of Ibi after some skirmishing, when
he saw approaching him not only Mesclop’s column, but Harispe coming
up from Alcoy with the 116th of the Line. He at once halted, turned
to the rear, and retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[p.
570]</span> in good order towards Xixona: the enemy’s cavalry tried
to break his rearguard but failed, and the whole division got back
to Alicante without loss. The same chance happened to Santesteban’s
cavalry, which, marching from Villena at 7 o’clock, had reached Biar,
in the enemy’s rear, only when the fighting—which had begun at 4—was
all over. O’Donnell tried to throw blame on this officer; but the
fact seems to be that his own calculation of time and distance was
faulty: he had sent his cavalry on too wide a sweep, separated by hills
from his main body, and had kept up no proper communication with it.
Nor does it appear that if Santesteban had come up to Biar a little
earlier he would have been able to accomplish anything very essential.
Bassecourt’s diversion, as might have been expected, did not work:
before he got near Alcoy the main body had been cut to pieces: he
retired in haste to Almanza on hearing the news.</p>

<p>O’Donnell’s infantry was so shattered that his army was reduced to
as bad a condition as it had shown in January, after Blake’s original
disaster at Valencia. He had lost over 3,000 men, of whom 2,135 were
unwounded prisoners, three flags, and the only two guns that had got
to the front. The survivors of the three broken brigades had dispersed
all over the countryside, and took weeks to collect. It was fortunate
that Roche’s division had reached Alicante intact, or that city itself
might have been in danger. The French had lost, according to their own
account, no more than 200 men<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746"
class="fnanchor">[746]</a>: only the two cavalry regiments, two
battalions of the 7th Line, and one of the 44th had been put into
action. As Suchet truly remarks in his <i>Mémoires</i><a id="FNanchor_747"
href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> the total numbers
engaged—3,000 men<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748"
class="fnanchor">[748]</a>—on his side were somewhat less than the
casualty list of the enemy.</p>

<p>The rout of Castalla put the Murcian army out of action for months—a
lucky thing for Suchet, since the force of the allies at Alicante was
just about to be increased by the arrival there<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_571">[p. 571]</span> of Maitland’s expedition, and if
O’Donnell’s army had been still intact, a very formidable body of
troops would have been collected opposite him. It remains to explain
the appearance of the Anglo-Sicilians in this direction, contrary to
the orders of Wellington, who had expressed his wish that they should
land in Catalonia, join Lacy, and lay siege to Tarragona—an operation
which he thought would force Suchet to evacuate Valencia altogether, in
order to bring help to Decaen.</p>

<p>We left Maitland anchored in the Bay of Palamos on July 31. The
moment that he appeared Eroles went on board his ship, to urge his
immediate disembarkation, and to promise the enthusiastic assistance
of the Catalans. The energetic baron gave a most optimistic picture of
the state of affairs, he declared that the whole country would rise
at the sight of the red-coats, that Tarragona was weakly held, and
that the total force of the French, including Suchet’s column near
Tortosa, was only 13,000 men. Lacy and Sarsfield appeared later, and
gave much less encouraging information: they rated the enemy at a far
higher figure than Eroles, and were right in so doing, for Decaen had
some 25,000 men, and could by an effort have concentrated 15,000,
exclusive of succours from Suchet. The Spanish Army of Catalonia could
only furnish 7,000 foot and 300 horse, of whom many were so far off
at the moment that Lacy declared that it would take six or eight days
to bring them up. By the time that they were all arrived, the French
would have concentrated also, and would be equal in numbers to the
whole force that the allies could collect. Tarragona was reported to
be in a better state of defence than Eroles allowed, and the engineers
declared that it might take ten days to reduce it. But the greatest
problem of all was that of provisions: Lacy declared that the country
could furnish little or nothing: he could not undertake to keep his own
small army concentrated for more than a week. The Anglo-Sicilians must
be fed from the fleet, and he could provide no transport. Evidently
the expedition would be tied down to the shore, and the siege of
Tarragona was the only possible operation. Since the Anglo-Sicilian
army could not manœuvre at large or retire into the inland, it would
have to fight Decaen, to cover the investment of Tarragona, within a
few days of its landing. On the other hand if, as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_572">[p. 572]</span> Eroles promised, the <i>somatenes</i> rose
on every side at the news of the disembarkation, the outlying French
troops might not be able to get up to join Decaen, the roads would be
blocked, the enemy might never be able to concentrate, and the force
about Barcelona, his only immediately available field army, was not
more than 8,000 strong, and might be beaten.</p>

<p>There were those who said that Lacy never wished to see the
expedition land, because he was jealous of Eroles, and thought that a
general rising which ended in success would have meant the end of his
own power and tenure of office<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749"
class="fnanchor">[749]</a>. It is at least certain that the views which
he expressed caused Maitland much trouble, and made him to flinch from
his original idea of landing without delay and attacking Tarragona,
according to Wellington’s desire. The English general took refuge in a
council of war—the usual resource of commanders of a wavering purpose.
His lieutenants all advised him to refuse to land, on the ground that
his forces were too small and heterogeneous, that Lacy could give no
prompt assistance, and that there was no sign as yet of the general
rising which Eroles promised. Moreover, some of the naval officers told
him that anchorage off the Catalan coast was so dangerous, even in
summer, that they could not promise him that the army could be taken
safely on board in case of a defeat. To the intense disgust of Eroles
and the other Catalan leaders, but not at all to Lacy’s displeasure,
Maitland accepted the advice of his council of war, and resolved to
make off, and to land farther south. The original idea was to have come
ashore somewhere in the midst of the long coast-line south of the Ebro,
between Tortosa and Valencia, with the object of breaking Suchet’s line
in the middle. But the news of Joseph O’Donnell’s gratuitous disaster
at Castalla, which obviously enabled the Marshal to use his whole
army against a disembarking force, and the suggestion that Alicante
itself might be in danger, induced Maitland in the end to order his
whole armament to steer southward. He arrived at Alicante on August
7th, and commenced to send his troops ashore—both his own 6,000 men
and Whittingham’s 4,000 auxiliaries of the Balearic division. Since
Roche was already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[p. 573]</span>
there, with his troops in good order, there were 14,000 men collected
in Alicante, over and above the wrecks of O’Donnell’s force. If only
the Murcians had been intact, the mass assembled would have caused
Suchet serious qualms, since it would have outnumbered the French
corps in Valencia very considerably, and there was in it a nucleus
of good troops in Maitland’s British and German battalions. The news
of Salamanca had also come to hand by this time, and had transformed
the general aspect of affairs in Suchet’s eyes: King Joseph was again
demanding instant help from him, in the hope of retaining Madrid,
and had called in (without his knowledge or consent) the division of
Palombini from Aragon, and the garrison of Cuenca<a id="FNanchor_750"
href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>. If Wellington should
advance—as he actually did—against the King, and should drive him from
his capital, it was possible that the main theatre of the war might be
transferred to the borders of Valencia.</p>

<p>The Marshal therefore resolved to concentrate: he ordered Habert and
Harispe to fall back behind the Xucar with their 8,000 men, abandoning
their advanced positions in front of Alicante, and placed them at
Jativa; here he threw up some field-works and armed a <i>tête-de-pont</i> on
the Xucar at Alberique. He ordered Paris’s brigade to come down from
northern Aragon to Teruel, and he warned the generals in Catalonia that
he might ask for reinforcements from them.</p>

<p>Maitland therefore, after his landing, found that the French had
disappeared from his immediate front. He was joined by Roche, and by
the 67th regiment from Cartagena, and proposed to drive Harispe from
Castalla and Ibi. But he marched against him on August 16th-18th, only
to find that he had already retired behind the Xucar. Farther than
Monforte he found himself unable to advance, for want of transport
and food. For the expedition from Sicily had not been fitted out for
an advance into the inland. It had been supposed by Bentinck that
the troops would be able to hire or requisition in Spain the mules
and carts that they would require for a forward movement. But the
country-side about Alicante was already exhausted by the long stay of
the Murcian army in that region; and O’Donnell—before Maitland had
come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[p. 574]</span> know the
difficulties of his position, got from him a pledge that he would
not take anything from it either by purchase or by requisition. The
British general had hired mules to draw his guns, but found that he
could not feed them on a forward march, because the resources of the
district were denied him. He himself had to stop at Elda, Roche at
Alcoy, because the problem of transport and food could not be solved.
All that he could do was to feel the French line of outposts behind the
Xucar with a flying column composed of his own handful of cavalry—200
sabres—and a detachment of Spanish horse lent him by Elio, the
successor of O’Donnell [August 20th-21st].</p>

<p>But even the thought of farther advance had now to be given up, for
the news arrived that King Joseph had evacuated Madrid on the 14th, and
was marching on Valencia with the 15,000 men that he had collected. To
have tried any further attack on Suchet, when such an army was coming
in from the flank to join the Marshal, would have been insane. The
French force in this region would be doubled in strength by the King’s
arrival. Wherefore Maitland drew back his own division to Alicante,
and brought Roche back to Xixona, not far in front of that fortress,
expecting that he might ere long be pushed back, and perhaps besieged
there. Wellington in the end of the month, having the same idea, sent
him elaborate directions for the defence of the place, bidding him
to hold it as long as possible, but to keep his transports close at
hand, and to re-embark if things came to the worst<a id="FNanchor_751"
href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>.</p>

<p>On the 25th King Joseph’s army and its vast convoy of French
and Spanish refugees, joined Suchet’s outposts at Almanza, and the
dangerous combination which Maitland and Wellington had foreseen came
to pass. But what was still more threatening for the army at Alicante
was the rumour that Soult was about to evacuate Andalusia, and to
bring the whole of the Army of the South to Valencia. This would mean
that nearly 80,000 French troops would ere long be collected within
striking distance of the motley force over which Maitland and Elio now
held command, and it seemed probable that Soult in his march might
sweep over the whole country-side, disperse the Spanish forces on the
Murcian border, and perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[p.
575]</span> besiege and take Cartagena and Alicante as a <i>parergon</i> on
the way. We have seen in chapter X that nothing of this kind happened:
Soult hung on to Andalusia for a month longer than Wellington or any
one else deemed probable: he only left Granada on September 17th, and
when he did move on Valencia he took the bad inland roads by Huescar,
Calasparra, and Hellin, leaving Murcia and Cartagena and the whole
sea-coast undisturbed. The reason, as has been already pointed out,
was the outbreak of yellow fever at Cartagena, which caused the Duke
of Dalmatia so much concern that he preferred to keep away from the
infection, even at the cost of taking inferior and circuitous roads.</p>

<p>For the whole of September, therefore, Suchet on the one side and
Maitland and the Spaniards on the other, were waiting on Soult: in the
expectation of his early arrival both sides kept quiet. Thus tamely
ended the first campaign of the Anglo-Sicilian army, on whose efforts
Wellington had so much counted. And its later operations, as we shall
presently see, were to be wholly in keeping with its unlucky start.</p>

  <h3 title="CHAPTER XII">SECTION XXXIII: CHAPTER XII</h3>
  <p class="subh3">WELLINGTON RETURNS TO THE DOURO. FINIS</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> garrison of the Retiro had
surrendered on August 14th: Wellington remained for seventeen days
longer in Madrid, and did not leave it, to take the field again, until
August 31st. His stay in the Spanish capital was not due, in the first
instance, to the causes which might seem most plausible—a desire to
give his war-worn infantry a rest during the hottest weeks of the year,
or a determination to reorganize the military resources of Madrid and
New Castile for the profit of the allied cause<a id="FNanchor_752"
href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>. Both these ideas
existed, and the latter in especial absorbed much of his attention—he
spent long hours in trying to concert, with Carlos de España, measures
for the utilization of the captured munitions of the Retiro, and for
the recruiting of the regiments of the Spanish ‘Fifth Army.’ In this
he accomplished less than he had hoped, partly because of the dreadful
exhaustion of the central provinces of Spain after the famine of the
preceding year, partly because of the inefficiency of most of the
Spanish officials with whom he had to deal. He was much discontented
with the list of persons appointed by the new Regency to take up
authority in the reconquered provinces; and Castaños, whom he most
trusted, and desired to have with him, was lingering in Galicia<a
id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>.</p>

<p>But the main reason for the halt at Madrid was the uncertainty as
to the movements of Soult. Was the Duke of Dalmatia about, as would
seem reasonable, to evacuate Andalusia? And if so, would he pick up
King Joseph and the Army of the Centre in La Mancha, and march on
Madrid with the 65,000 men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[p.
577]</span> whom they could collect? Or would he retire on Valencia and
join Suchet? Or again, would he persist in his intention, expressed
in dispatches to Joseph, which had fallen into Wellington’s hands, of
holding on to Andalusia and making it a separate base of French power,
despite of the fact that he had been cut off from communication with
the imperial armies of the East and North?</p>

<p>‘Any other but a modern French army would now leave the province
[of Andalusia],’ wrote Wellington to Lord Bathurst on July 18<a
id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>, ‘as
they have now absolutely no communication of any kind with France or
with any other French army; and they are pressed on all sides by troops
not to be despised, and can evidently do nothing. Yet I suspect that
Soult will not stir till I force him out by a direct movement upon him:
and I think of making that movement as soon as I can take the troops
to the South without injuring their health.’ All military reasons were
against the probability of Soult’s holding on in Andalusia, yet he had
certainly expressed his intention of doing so as late as the middle of
July, and, what was more important still in judging of his plans, he
had not made a sudden movement of retreat when the news of Salamanca
reached him. Hill writing on August 4th, six days after the receipt of
the tidings of Marmont’s disaster, had to report<a id="FNanchor_755"
href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> that ‘the recent
glorious event’ seemed to have had very little effect on the enemy, who
‘continued in a strong position in his front.’ And this was true, for
Soult, after hearing the news of Salamanca, had made his last frantic
appeal to King Joseph to fall back on Andalusia, and make his base at
Seville if Madrid were lost. Wellington was right in suspecting that,
if the Marshal had got his desire, the South would have been maintained
against him, and he would have had to march thither in person, to pick
up Hill, and to bring matters to an issue by another pitched battle.
It was only on August 12th that Soult reluctantly resolved to evacuate
Andalusia: his first precautionary movements for retreat were made on
August 15th, but it was not till the 24th that the Cadiz Lines were
destroyed, or till the 26th that all the French troops in front of
Hill suddenly vanished. Wellington was therefore kept for more<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[p. 578]</span> than a fortnight in
a state of complete uncertainty as to whether he might not have to
march southward in the end, to evict Soult from his viceroyalty. It
was only on the 24th that he got information from Hill (written on
the 17th) which gave the first premonitory warning that the French
seemed to be on the move<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756"
class="fnanchor">[756]</a>. Next day confirming evidence began to come
to hand: ‘it is generally reported, and I have reason to believe, that
the Army of the South is about to make a general movement ... it is
supposed in the direction of Granada and Valencia<a id="FNanchor_757"
href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>.’ On August 30, ‘though
Sir Rowland Hill on the 17th instant had no intelligence that the
march was commenced, there was every appearance of it.’ The fact that
seemed to make it incredible that Soult could be proposing to hold
Andalusia any longer, was precise information that King Joseph and the
Army of the Centre had marched upon Valencia to join Suchet, and had
passed Chinchilla on August 24th, going eastward<a id="FNanchor_758"
href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>. If the King had
gone by the passes of the Sierra Morena southward, to join Soult,
doubt might still have been possible: but since he had made Valencia
his goal, and was crawling slowly along in that direction with his
immense convoy of refugees and baggage, Soult—left entirely to his
own resources—could not retain his present position. He must march on
Valencia also, and it would be many weeks before he could place himself
in touch with Suchet, and produce a threatening combination on the
Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>On August 31st, therefore, with no absolutely certain news yet
to hand as to Soult’s retreat, but with every military probability
in favour of its having been begun, Wellington resolved to leave
Madrid and to return to the valley of the Douro, where the movements
of Clausel and the French Army of Portugal demanded his attention.
He never thought for a moment of endeavouring to march through La
Mancha to intercept or molest Soult’s retreat. The distance was
too great, the roads unknown, the problem of feeding the army in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[p. 579]</span> desolate
and thinly-peopled country about the Murcian and Andalusian borders
too difficult. Wellington made up his mind that he had some time
to spare: he would march against Clausel and then ‘return to this
part of the country [Madrid] as soon as I shall have settled
matters to my satisfaction on the right of the Douro. And I hope I
shall be here [Madrid] and shall be joined by the troops under Sir
Rowland Hill, before Soult can have made much progress to form his
junction with the King<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759"
class="fnanchor">[759]</a>.’ It is important, therefore, to realize
that, in Wellington’s original conception, the operations in Old
Castile, which we may call the Burgos campaign, were to be but a
side-issue, an intermediate and secondary matter. The real danger
in Spain, as he considered, was the approaching, but not immediate,
junction of Soult, Suchet, and King Joseph at Valencia. And the
Commander-in-Chief evidently proposed to be at Madrid, to face this
combination, by October 1st. How and why he failed to carry out this
intention must be explained at length in the next volume.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when he marched off to the Douro with part of his army,
he had to make provisions for the conduct of affairs in the South
during his absence. Hill, as has been shown in another chapter, had
been told to march on Madrid, as soon as Soult’s forces had made their
definitive departure for the East. As Drouet only disappeared from
Hill’s front on August 26th, the northward march of the army from
Estremadura began late: it had not commenced to cross the Guadiana
on September 1: its progress to and along the Tagus valley was slow,
owing to the difficulty of procuring food, and its main body had not
reached Almaraz and Talavera before the 20th September, and was only
concentrated about and behind Toledo at the end of the month. But
though Hill’s movement was not rapid, it was made in sufficiently good
time to face the danger that was brewing on the side of Valencia.
And there can be no doubt that if he had received orders to hurry,
he could have been in line some days before he actually appeared<a
id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>.
He brought up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[p. 580]</span>
all his force<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761"
class="fnanchor">[761]</a> except Buchan’s Portuguese brigade<a
id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>,
which was left at Truxillo and Merida, to keep up his communication
with Elvas. Estremadura, so long the contending ground of armies,
had now no solid body of troops left in it save the Spanish garrison
of Badajoz. For Penne Villemur and Morillo, with the division which
had so long operated in Hill’s vicinity, moved with him into New
Castile. They went by the rugged roads through the mountains of
the province of Toledo<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763"
class="fnanchor">[763]</a>, and took post at Herencia, on the high-road
from Madrid to the Despeñaperros pass, in front of the British 2nd
Division.</p>

<p>In the rear of Hill’s column, and separated from it by many days’
march, was another small British force toiling up to Madrid from a very
distant point. This was the force under Colonel Skerrett, which had
taken part in the fighting round Seville. It consisted of the battalion
of the Guards from Cadiz, the 2/47th and 2/87th, two companies of the
2/95th, a squadron of the 2nd Hussars K.G.L., the 20th Portuguese
Line, and a battery. By Wellington’s orders no British troops were now
left in Cadiz save the 2/59th, part of de Watteville’s regiment, the
‘battalion of foreign recruits,’ soon to become the 8/60th, and a few
artillery. Skerrett’s column, some 4,000 strong, marched by Merida
and Truxillo, and reached Toledo in time to join Hill for the autumn
campaign in front of Madrid. Hill’s corps, when joined by Skerrett,
provided a force of over 20,000 men, about equally divided between
British and Portuguese.</p>

<p>It would have been profitable to Wellington, as matters went in
the end, if he had handed over the entire task of observing Soult’s
operations to Hill. But being under the impression that he would return
ere long to Madrid, he left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[p.
581]</span> there and in the neighbourhood nearly half the force
that he had brought from Salamanca. He only took with him to oppose
Clausel the 1st, 5th, and 7th Divisions, with Pack’s and Bradford’s
Portuguese, and Bock’s and Ponsonby’s (late Le Marchant’s) brigades
of heavy dragoons, a force of some 21,000 men<a id="FNanchor_764"
href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>. He left the 3rd and
Light Divisions at Madrid, the 4th Division at the Escurial, and
Carlos de España’s Spaniards at Segovia. The cavalry of Victor Alten
and D’Urban were assigned to this force, and remained, the former
at Madrid, the latter at the Palacio de Rio Frio, near Segovia. The
British infantry divisions had all suffered heavily at Badajoz, and the
4th at Salamanca also—they were weak in numbers, but were expecting
ere long to be joined by numerous convalescents. The total force
left behind amounted to about 17,000 men, including the Spaniards<a
id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>. Thus
when Hill and Skerrett came up from the South, there was a mass of
nearly 40,000 men accumulated round Madrid, while Wellington himself,
after picking up Clinton and the 6th Division, and the other troops
left on the Douro, had a little under 30,000. This proved in the autumn
campaign an ideally bad partition of the army, for on each wing the
Anglo-Portuguese force was decidedly less numerous than that which
the French could bring against it. If Wellington had taken his full
strength to the North, he could have defied Clausel and Caffarelli,
and they could never have made head against him, or pressed him away
from Burgos. Hill, on the other hand, in front of Madrid, would have
been no more helpless with 22,000 men than he actually was with 38,000
men, when Soult and King Joseph brought 60,000 against him in October.
In either case he could only retreat without offering battle. But
Wellington, if the three additional divisions left in New Castile had
been brought to the North, would have had such a superiority over
the French in Old Castile that he could have dealt with them as he
pleased. The only explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[p.
582]</span> of the unfortunate proportional division of his army, is
that Wellington undervalued the task he had to execute beyond the
Douro, thought that he could finish it more quickly than was to be the
case, and calculated on being back at Madrid in October before Soult
could give trouble.</p>

<p>Yet when he started he was not comfortable in his mind about the
general situation. If the French drew together, their total strength
in Spain was far too great for him. In a moody moment he wrote to
his brother Henry: ‘though I still hope to be able to maintain our
position in Castile, and even to improve our advantages, I shudder
when I reflect upon the enormity of the task which I have undertaken,
with inadequate powers myself to do anything, and without assistance
of any kind from the Spaniards.... I am apprehensive that all this
may turn out ill for the Spanish cause. If by any cause I should be
overwhelmed, or should be obliged to retire, what will the world say?
What will the people of England say? What will those in Spain say?<a
id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>’</p>

<p>Wellington’s forebodings were, only too soon, to be justified. But
the tale of the campaign against Clausel and Caffarelli, of the advance
to and retreat from Burgos, must be told in another volume.</p>

<p class="centra ws1">BRITISH LOSSES DURING THE SIEGE</p>

<p class="note mt1">The British losses between the investment and the
storm were, according to the official returns at the Record Office, 1
officer and 69 men killed, 19 officers and 462 men wounded, 2 men (both
Portuguese) missing, or a total of 553. These figures added to the 568
lost in the storm (for details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[p.
588]</span> see below), make altogether 1,121, which does not agree
with the statement in Wellington <i>Dispatches</i>, viii. p. 557; this gives
as the total for the siege 9 officers and 169 men killed, 70 officers
and 748 men wounded, 7 men missing, or only 1,003, over a hundred less
than the total from the return quoted above. Napier gives 1,290 as the
casualties for the whole siege, which much exceeds the return in the
Record Office; he also makes the total for the storm 60 officers and
650 killed and wounded, while the official return here printed makes it
only 59 officers and 509 men. Lord Londonderry and Sir John Jones also
give figures agreeing with no others. I prefer to take the total of the
official report, which is here appended.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>
  <p class="subh3">NOTE ON SOME POINTS OF CONTROVERSY<br />
    REGARDING THE STORM OF CIUDAD RODRIGO</p>
</div>

<p class="note">Beside the controversy alluded to on page 183 about the
exact amount of co-operation by the Light Division in helping the 3rd
to clear the French from behind the Greater Breach, there are several
other vexed points concerning the storm of Ciudad Rodrigo. The one on
which most dispute arose was that concerning the capture of General
Barrié. Gurwood of the 52nd claimed to have been the first officer to
enter the Castle, and to receive the surrender of the governor and his
staff. He is mentioned as doing so in Wellington’s Rodrigo dispatch,
and generally had the credit at the time. But Lieutenant Mackie of
the 88th, who had led the forlorn hope of the 3rd Division, also put
in a claim, and had many supporters. Many years after the war was
over, Maxwell (the author of one of the several <i>Lives of the Duke
of Wellington</i>, which came out in early Victorian times) championed
Mackie’s claim with such vehemence that Gurwood issued a pamphlet
defending his own credit. Considerable controversy arose in the <i>United
Service Journal</i> for 1843, and elsewhere. Mackie’s story was that
he, with some of the 88th, arrived first at the Castle, summoned the
governor to surrender, and was received by several French officers,
who handed him over a sword and announced that the general yielded.
Some moments after, according to Mackie, Gurwood came up, spoke to the
governor himself, and obtained his sword, which, when the prisoners
were brought before Wellington, he presented to his commander, who
gave it him back, telling him to retain it as a trophy, and entered
Gurwood’s name in his dispatch as the officer who had received the
surrender. Gurwood’s story, told with as much detail and circumstance
as Mackie’s, is that he, with two soldiers of the 52nd, arrived at the
citadel, got the gate opened by threatening the officer in charge that
no quarter would be given if resistance were made, and was received
by Barrié, who in a great state of nervousness, threw his arms round
his neck, kissed him, and said, ‘<i>je suis le Gouverneur de la place—je
suis votre prisonnier</i>,’ handing over his sword at the same time.
He accompanied the captive staff-officers to Wellington’s presence,
and presented them to him. It is difficult to come to any certain
conclusion in face of two such contradictory tales, but there is a
bare possibility of reconciling them, by supposing that Mackie entered
first, that the door was closed behind him and his party, and that
Gurwood was let in a moment later, and spoke to the governor, while
Mackie had been dealing only with his aide-de-camp, whose sword he had
received. But if so, it is odd that Gurwood never saw Mackie: Mackie is
quite positive that he saw Gurwood, and that he came in some minutes
later than himself. The dispute tended to become a controversy between
Light Division and 3rd Division veterans, each backing their own man. A
synopsis of the papers may be found in the last two chapters of vol. i
of Grattan’s second series of <i>Adventures with the Connaught Rangers</i>
(London, 1853). Napier, who was much interested in the discussion,
put in his final definitive edition the non-committal statement that
‘the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[p. 590]</span> garrison fled
to the Castle, where Lieutenant Gurwood, who though severely wounded
had entered among the foremost at the Lesser Breach, received the
governor’s sword’ (iv. p. 90). Harry Smith says (i. p. 58): ‘Gurwood
got great credit here unfairly. Johnstone and poor Uniacke were the
first on the ramparts, Gurwood having been knocked down in the breach,
and momentarily stunned. However, Gurwood’s a sharp fellow, and he cut
off in search of the governor and brought his sword to the Duke. He
made the <i>most</i> of it.’</p>

<p class="note">Another controversy is as to which troops of the 3rd
Division got first into the body of the town. The 88th claimed the
priority, but also the 94th. The late Mr. Andrew Lang lent me a very
interesting letter of his kinsman, William Lang of the 94th, very
clearly stating that a solid body of 200 men of his regiment were the
first troops that penetrated in force to the Plaza Mayor, and received
the surrender of the garrison there.</p>

<p class="note">Still another controversy, about which there is much in
the Rice Jones papers, in the possession of Commander Hon. Henry Shore,
R.N., is as to what engineer officers conducted the storming-columns.
Apparently some credit has been misplaced among individuals here, but
to decide upon the point would take more space than a book like this
can afford.</p>

<p class="note mt1">Adding up these four totals we get officers 2,156,
rank and file 52,795 = 54,951. This total omits the artillery in the
Cadiz Lines and other fortified places, and the three marine regiments,
and such sappers, gendarmes, military train, &amp;c., as did not form
part of the expedition that marched with Soult to relieve Badajoz.
Adding these, at their strength of March 1, we get a total of about
59,000 of all ranks, not including the garrison of Badajoz. This agrees
well enough with the March total of 60,663, allowing for a month’s wear
and tear.</p>

<p class="note mt1">A report of the governor at noon on April 5, found
among his papers after the storm, gave the following as surviving under
arms (sick excluded)—infantry 3,403, artillery 282, engineers 217,
cavalry 50, <i>Juramentados</i> 86. This report, printed in Jones, i. p.
230, implies a higher original total than Belmas allows—the artillery
and <i>Juramentados</i> are actually more numerous on April 5 than on
March 15! And the infantry are only 458 less, despite of losses of a
considerably higher figure, for another paper of the commandant shows
(Jones, i. p. 230)—Sortie of March 19: killed 30, wounded 287=317<a
id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>.
Storm of Picurina Fort: killed or prisoners, 8 officers, 278 men =
286. We have thus 603 casualties in these two affairs only, beside the
ordinary wear and tear of the siege.</p>

<p class="note">Noting the considerable number of ‘round figures’ in
Belmas’s table, I am inclined to think that the total of the garrison
must have been a few hundreds over what he allows.</p>

Losses of the British by the return annexed to Wellington’s dispatch:
those of the Portuguese from the official returns at Lisbon. The
fighting strength on July 22, owing to losses at Castrejon and
Castrillo, and to weary men falling out during the retreat, may have
been perhaps 1,000 less.</p>

  <h3>XI</h3>
  <p class="subh3">STRENGTH AND LOSSES OF MARMONT’S ARMY AT&nbsp;SALAMANCA</p>
</div>

<p class="note">To fix the fighting strength of Marmont’s army at
Salamanca is comparatively easy. It consisted of the 49,636 officers
and men accounted for by the return of July 15th printed on the next
page, minus some 700 men lost at the combats of Castrillo and Castrejon
[also called ‘combat of the Guarena’] on July 18, and such few hundreds
more as may have fallen behind from fatigue during the long marches
of July 20-1. Roughly speaking, it must have counted some 48,500 men,
as opposed to Wellington’s 50,000. The French translators of Napier’s
<i>Peninsular War</i> (Mathieu Dumas and Foltz) only give a table of June
15, which is of course a month out of date for Salamanca, and append
a note that ‘deducting artillery, engineers, <i>équipages militaires</i>,
officers, sergeants, and garrisons, as also losses between June 15 and
July 15 they find the result of about 42,000 sabres and bayonets for
the battle.’ Why any sane person <i>should</i> deduct officers, sergeants,
and artillerymen from a fighting total I am unable to conceive, though
contemporary British writers, including Wellington himself, often did
so. But the results of adding to their ‘42,000 sabres and bayonets’
the list of 1,925 officers, 3,244 artillerymen and artillery train
(both in the divisions and in the reserve), 332 engineers, and 742
<i>équipages militaires</i>, is to give the figure 48,343, which practically
agrees with the total that I state above; if sergeants are added it
would much exceed that total. We may take this, therefore, as fairly
correct—bearing in mind that the 26 officers and 742 men of the
<i>équipages militaires</i> cannot be counted as combatants.</p>

<p class="note">These totals do not include the 23rd Léger (2 batts.)
and the 2/1st Line, both from Thomières’s division, which were
garrisoning Astorga, about 1,500 strong. Nor do they include the minor
garrisons left at Toro, Zamora, Olmedo, Valdestillas, Tordesillas,
Simancas, Cabezon, Medina del Campo, Puente de Duero, Tudela de Douro,
Amagro, &amp;c., which appear to have been altogether about 4,184
strong, nor the dépôts at Valladolid, 3,307 strong on June 15, but
probably much less on July 15, when Marmont had remounted nearly 1,000
dismounted dragoons and picked up all detachments and convalescents
that he could gather. Nor do they include the sick, who had been 8,633
on June 15th, and 8,332 on May 15th—probably the total in hospital was
a trifle more on July 15, owing to the fatigues of the campaigns round
San Cristobal in the latter days of June.</p>

<p class="note">Parallel with the return of July 15th, I have printed
that of August 1. The difference between the two—211 officers and
10,124 men—might be supposed to represent the losses in the campaign
between those dates. It does not, however, because the total of August
1 represents not only the survivors from the battle of Salamanca, but
all the men from garrisons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">[p.
601]</span> evacuated after it, and from the Valladolid dépôt, who
joined the colours after the disaster of July 22, in consequence of the
district in which they were lying having been evacuated by the army.
The garrisons of Toro and Zamora held out till they were relieved, that
of Tordesillas surrendered to the Galicians: but the men from the other
smaller garrisons and from the dépôts fell in to their respective corps
before August 1. I imagine that we may take these additions to be some
5,000 men at least, but cannot give the exact figures, through being
unable to say what the Valladolid dépôts (3,307 strong on June 15)
amounted to on July 15.</p>

<p class="note">After comparing the totals of the brigades and
regiments shown under July 15 and August 1, we must proceed to show the
reasons why, in individual cases, the regimental differences between
the two sets of figures cannot be taken to represent the sum of the
losses in the Salamanca campaign. The proof is clear.</p>

<p class="note mt1">General total 60 officers killed, 347 wounded at
Salamanca and Garcia Hernandez; plus 7 officers killed and 27 wounded
at the Guarena on July 18, and 2 wounded in minor engagements.</p>

<p class="note">Loss in killed and wounded, not including unwounded
prisoners, during the campaign, 67 killed, 376 wounded = 443 officers
in all.</p>

<p class="note">After arriving at this general loss in killed and
wounded officers, so far as is possible from Martinien’s tables, which
are not quite complete for all corps, it only remains to estimate
the unwounded prisoners. I searched the immense volumes of rolls of
French officers in captivity at the Record Office, and found 63 names
of prisoners taken at Salamanca, the Guarena, and Garcia Hernandez.
A few of these duplicate the names of wounded officers to be found
in Martinien’s tables, the remainder must represent the unwounded
prisoners. Wellington in his Salamanca dispatch wrote that he had 137
French officers prisoners—evidently the larger number of them must have
been wounded, as only 63 were sent off to England that autumn. Probably
many died in hospital. Prisoners are most numerous from the 101st,
22nd, and from Foy’s two regiments cut up at Garcia Hernandez, the 76th
and 6th Léger.</p>

<p class="note">In the Library of the <i>Archives de la Guerre</i> at the
Paris Ministry of War I went through the regimental histories of all
the French infantry regiments present at Salamanca. Like our own
similar compilations, they differ much in value—some are very full
and with statistics carefully worked out from regimental reports and
pay-books; others are very thin and factless. Fourteen units give their
losses, which I herewith annex:</p>

<p class="note">Clausel’s Division: 25th Léger, 336; 27th Line, 159;
59th Line, 350.</p>

<p class="note">Ferey’s Division: 70th Line, 111; 31st Léger, 340.</p>

<p class="note">Sarrut’s Division: 2nd Léger, 202.</p>

<p class="note">Maucune’s Division: 15th Line, 359.</p>

<p class="note">Brennier’s Division: 17th Léger, 264; 65th Line,
359.</p>

<p class="note">Thomières’s Division: 1st Line, 227; 62nd Line, 868;
101st Line, 1,000.</p>

<p class="note">Bonnet’s Division: 120th, 458; 122nd, 527.</p>

<p class="note">The total of this makes 5,560 for these fourteen
corps; we leave fifteen others unaccounted for. As a rough calculation
I suppose that we may hold that as these regiments lost, as we know
from Martinien’s lists [which are not <i>quite</i> complete], at least 152
officers out of 5,560 of all ranks, then the other fifteen regiments
with 181 officers killed or wounded must have lost something like
6,000. The vagaries of the proportion between officers and men hit are
extraordinary in individual units, but these<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_606">[p. 606]</span> tend to rectify themselves on a large
total consisting of many regiments. I therefore believe that 11,560
would be something very like the total loss <i>killed and wounded</i> in the
French infantry. We have then to allow for some 40 unwounded officers
taken prisoners, and corresponding to them perhaps 1,200 unwounded men.
The total loss for the infantry would thus be 12,800. For cavalry and
artillery, &amp;c., 53 officers hit—as by Martinien’s tables—must imply
something over a thousand men lost. We should thus arrive at a total
of 14,000 for the casualties—the sum which I suggest in my text (p.
469).</p>

<p class="note">To show the worthlessness of any attempt to deduce the
French losses by a mere comparison of the official ‘morning states’ of
July 15 and August 1, the following instances may suffice.</p>

<p class="note">The 65th Line shows 59 officers and 1,527 men present
on July 15, 52 officers and 1,302 men on August 1. The apparent loss
is 7 officers and 225 men. But this unit’s regimental report shows 3
officers killed, 5 officers wounded, 204 men killed or prisoners, 106
men wounded, 39 missing; total, 8 officers and 349 men. Therefore, as
is obvious, one officer and 124 men must have joined from somewhere
(dépôt at Valladolid?) between the two dates, or the deficiency would
be 125 greater between the ‘present under arms’ of the two dates than
is shown.</p>

<p class="note">A more striking case is the 62nd Line, of Thomières’s
Division. It shows present on July 15, 47 officers and 1,076 men,
on August 1st 45 officers and 1,048 men—the apparent loss is only 2
officers and 28 men. But Martinien’s lists show us that the regiment
lost at least 15 officers, killed and wounded, and the regimental
report gives 20 officers and 848 men killed, wounded, or missing!
The real loss is 868 not 30! Therefore 18 officers and about 800
men, the equivalent of a strong battalion, must have joined between
July 15 and August 1. This corresponds to the fact that the 62nd
showed only 2 battalions<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787"
class="fnanchor">[787]</a> at Salamanca, while the ‘morning state’ of
June 15th showed it as having at the front three battalions and 1,900
rank and file. Clearly the third battalion rejoined the colours after
the battle—having presumably been quartered in the small garrisons of
Castile evacuated after the disaster of July 22. Many men must also
have rejoined the other two battalions.</p>

<p class="note">But the most absurd case of all is that of the 47th
Line, whose total figures actually <i>go up</i> from 1,625 to 1,712 of all
ranks between July 15th and August 1st—in despite of the fact that it
lost (as Martinien’s lists show), 18 officers and not less therefore
than 360 rank and file (20 men per officer is a low allowance) at
Salamanca. It must have picked up from Valladolid and the small
garrisons 13 officers and 452 men at least<a id="FNanchor_788"
href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>.</p>

<p class="note">Clausel, writing to King Joseph on July 25, said that
of the whole Army of Portugal he could not yet show in the field on
that day 20,000 men. This tallies well enough with the conclusion that
we have already drawn, that the total loss from the army, which on July
15 had about 48,000 men, must have been some 14,000 killed, wounded,
and prisoners, and over 10,000 men dispersed who were only just
rallying.</p>

<p class="mt1">It may be well to give here the garrisons of Cadiz and
Gibraltar in 1812, as both of them supplied troops to the field army
during that year.</p>

<p>In Gibraltar, under General Campbell, there were the 2/9th, 2/11th,
37th, and the 4th and 7th Veteran Battalions throughout the year.
The 1/82nd was there till the summer, when it was relieved by the
1/26th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">[p. 611]</span> sent
back from Portugal by Wellington. The 1/82nd sailed for Lisbon and
marched up to the front, but arrived just too late for the battle of
Salamanca.</p>

<p>At Cadiz General Cooke commanded, at the commencement of the year,
the 3/1st Guards (which had arrived and relieved the ‘composite
battalion of Guards’ before the end of 1811), also the 2/47th, 2/67th,
2/87th, two companies of the <i>Chasseurs Britanniques</i>, De Watteville’s
regiment (which arrived before the end of 1811), the strange corps
sometimes called the ‘battalion of Foreign Deserters,’ sometimes the
‘battalion of Foreign Recruits,’ two companies of the 2/95th, and a
squadron of the 2nd Hussars K.G.L., also the 20th Portuguese.</p>

<p>Early in the year the 2/67th and five companies of De Watteville’s
regiment were sent off to Cartagena.</p>

<p>In September the 3/1st Guards, 2/47th, 2/87th, two companies 95th,
and 20th Portuguese marched to join Hill at Madrid, taking with them
the German squadron and two field-batteries: they were just 4,000
strong.</p>

<p>The 2/59th came out from home about the same time, and was in
October the only <i>British</i> battalion at Cadiz. With them remained
the ‘Foreign Deserters,’ seven companies of De Watteville, and two
companies of <i>Chasseurs Britanniques</i>, as also some artillerymen.</p>

  <h3>XV</h3>
  <p class="subh3">THE SCOVELL CIPHERS</p>
</div>

<div class="note">

<p>By the very great kindness of Mr. G. Scovell of Brighton, I have
had placed at my disposition the papers of his great-uncle, General
Sir George Scovell, G.C.B., who served during the Peninsular War in
the Intelligence branch of the Quartermaster-General’s department.
In the beginning of 1812 the number of intercepted French dispatches
in cipher which came into Wellington’s hands, through the happy
activity of Julian Sanchez and other guerrillero chiefs, began to be
so considerable that the Commander-in-Chief thought it worth while
to detail a member of his staff to deal with them. Captain Scovell
was selected because of his ingenuity in this line, and became
responsible for attempting to interpret all the captured documents.
They were made over to him, and, having done what he could with them,
he placed the fair-copy of the ‘decoded’ result in Wellington’s hands,
but seems to have been allowed to keep the originals—which were, of
course, unintelligible because of their form, and therefore useless
to his chief. The file of documents which thus remained with him
is most interesting: they range in size from formal dispatches of
considerable bulk—eight or ten folio pages long—down to scraps of the
smallest size written on thin paper, and folded up so as to go into
some secret place of concealment on the bearer’s person. Some of them
look as if they had been sewed up in a button, or rolled under the
leather of a whip handle, or pushed along the seam of a garment. I
take it that these must all have been entrusted to emissaries sent in
disguise, <i>Afrancesados</i> or peasants hired by a great bribe. Presumably
each of these scraps cost the life of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_612">[p. 612]</span> bearer when it was discovered—for the
guerrillero chiefs did not deal mildly with Spaniards caught carrying
French secret orders. The large folio dispatches, on the other hand,
must no doubt have been carried by French aides-de-camp or couriers,
whose escorts were dispersed or captured by the <i>partidas</i> at some
corner of the mountain roads between Madrid and the head-quarters of
the Armies of Portugal and Andalusia.</p>

<p>The cipher letters are of two sorts—in the first (and more numerous)
class only the names of persons and places, and the most important
sentences are in cipher—invariably a numerical cipher of arbitrary
figures. In the other class the whole dispatch is written in figures,
not merely its more weighty clauses. The reason for adopting the former
method was that it saved much time; the transliterating of unimportant
parts of the dispatch (such as compliments, and personal remarks of
no strategical import) would have taken many extra hours, when it was
necessary to get a letter sent off in a hurry. But, as we shall see
later on, there was grave danger in using this system, because the
context might sometimes allow the decipherer to make a good guess at
the disguised words, after reading that part of the letter which was
not so guarded.</p>

<p>Occasionally a French dispatch is ciphered after the same infantile
system that readers of romances will remember in Poe’s <i>Gold Bug</i> or
Conan Doyle’s <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, where letters or numbers are merely
substituted for each other—where, for example, <span class="m">2</span>
always means letter <i>e</i>, or <span class="m">25</span> letter <i>r</i>. This
sort of cipher is dangerously easy to an expert reader, especially if
the words are separated from each other, so that the number of letters
in each can be counted. Take, for example, a letter sent to Soult in
1813 by Cassan, the blockaded governor of Pampeluna<a id="FNanchor_797"
href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>. Only one precaution
had been taken in this cipher-epistle, viz. that elaborate care has
been taken to defeat the attempt of the reader to arrive at results by
counting what figures appear most frequently, and so deducing by their
repetition that these must be <i>e</i> (the most frequently used letter in
French, as in English), <i>s</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>t</i>, and other common letters.
This is done by having six alternative numbers for <i>e</i>, four each for
<i>a</i> and <i>i</i>, three for <i>t</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>n</i>. Taking the simple phrase</p>

<p class="mono">47.50.40.41.14.26<br />
58.24<br />
3.51.10.36.44.23.17.24.10.50.53.27<br />
47.46<br />
11.18.39.17.46.21,</p>

<p class="ti0">which deciphers into ‘depuis le commencement du
blocus,’ we see that <i>e</i> appears five times, but is represented
by both <span class="m">50</span>, <span class="m">24</span>, and
<span class="m">44</span>; <i>u</i> three times, but varied as <span
class="m">14</span> and <span class="m">46</span>; <i>m</i> thrice, varied
as <span class="m">10</span> and <span class="m">36</span>. This made
the reader’s work harder, but not nearly so difficult as that required
for certain other ciphers: for the whole set of signs, being not much
over 60 in number, there was a limited amount of possibilities for each
figure-interpretation. And the words being separated by spaces, there
was a certainty that some of the two-letter units must represent <i>et</i>,
<i>de</i>, <i>ce</i>, <i>eu</i>, <i>du</i>, and similar common French two-letter words. As
a matter of fact this particular dispatch was deciphered in a few hours
owing to the lucky guess that its initial words</p>

<p class="mono">10.45.23.21.16.2.41.25<br /> 5.24<br />
10.4.25.24.3.9.8.5</p>

<p class="ti0">might be ‘Monsieur le Maréchal,’ the preliminary address
to the intended recipient. This hypothesis was verified at once by
finding that this rendering made good sense for the two-letter words
<span class="m">23.24</span> = <i>ne</i>, and <span class="m">10.2</span> =
<i>me</i>, lower down in the letter. After this all was plain sailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">[p. 613]</span></p> <p>But the
usual French cipher, the ‘Great Paris Cipher’ as Scovell called it,
was a very much more complicated and difficult affair, as the list
of figures, instead of being only a few score, ran to many hundreds.
And of these only some few represented individual letters, more were
parts of a syllabary: <i>ma</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>mo</i>, <i>mu</i>, for example, had
each a figure representing them, and so had <i>ab</i>- <i>ac</i>- <i>ad</i>- <i>af</i>-
<i>ag</i>- &amp;c. Moreover, there was a multitude of arbitrary numbers,
representing under a single figure words that must often be used in a
dispatch, such as <i>hommes</i>, <i>armée</i>, <i>général</i>, <i>marche</i>, <i>ennemi</i>,
<i>corps d’armée</i>, <i>canons</i>. In addition there was a code of proper
names, e.g. <span class="m">1216</span> meant the River Douro, <span
class="m">93</span> Portugal, <span class="m">1279</span> Talavera,
<span class="m">585</span> King Joseph, <span class="m">1391</span>
General Dorsenne, <span class="m">1327</span> the Army of the South,
<span class="m">1280</span> Soult, <span class="m">1300</span>
Wellington, <span class="m">400</span> Ciudad Rodrigo, &amp;c. If the
King wished the Duke of Dalmatia to send 9,000 men of the Army of the
South to Talavera, he had only to write</p>

<p class="cita">‘<span class="m">585</span> désire que <span
class="m">1280</span> dirige <span class="m">1156</span> (neuf) <span
class="m">692</span> (mille) <span class="m">1102</span> (hommes) de
<span class="m">1327</span> sur <span class="m">1279</span>.’</p>

<p class="ti0">He would then cut up <i>désire</i> and <i>dirige</i> into the
syllables <i>de-si-re</i> and <i>di-ri-ge</i>, for each of which the syllabary
had set figures; there were also arbitrary numbers for <i>sur</i>, <i>de</i>, and
<i>que</i>. So the whole sentence would take up only fourteen numbers when
written out.</p>

<p>It would seem at first sight that to interpret such a dispatch would
be a perfectly hopeless task, to any one who had not the key to the
cipher before him. That the admirably patient and ingenious Scovell
at last made out for himself a key from the laborious comparison of
documents, was nevertheless the fact. He was started on the track by
the fortunate circumstance that most of the intercepted dispatches were
only <i>partly</i> in cipher. Marmont would write</p>

<p class="cita">‘Avec les moyens que j’ai, et <span class="m">798,
1118, 602, 131, 1112.663.1135.502</span> au delà de Sabugal,’</p>

<p class="ti0">or</p>

<p class="cita">‘J’avais donné l’ordre que <span class="m">1003, 497,
1115, 1383, 69,711, 772, 530</span>, de descendre cette rivière et de
se mettre en communication avec moi.’</p>

<p class="ti0">Clearly the cipher-figures in the first case have
something to do with a march on Sabugal, in the second with orders
to some general or body of troops (to be identified hereafter) to
march down a river which the context shows must be the Tagus. This
is not much help, and the task looked still very hopeless. But when
intercepted dispatches accumulated in quantities, and the same
cipher-figures kept occurring among sentences of which part was written
out in full, it became evident that various cryptic figures must mean
places and persons who could be guessed at, with practical certainty.
Occasionally a French writer completely ‘gives himself away’ by
carelessness: e.g. Dorsenne wrote on April 16 to Jourdan,</p>

<p class="cita">‘Vous voulez de renseignement sur la situation
militaire et administrative de <span class="m">1238</span>:’</p>

<p class="ti0">obviously the probable interpretation of this number
is ‘the Army of the North,’ and this is rendered almost certain by
passages lower down the same letter. Equally incautious is King Joseph
when he writes to Marmont,</p>

<p class="cita">‘J’ai donné l’ordre au général Treillard de <span
class="m">117.8.7</span> la vallée du <span class="m">1383</span>, afin
de marcher à <span class="m">498</span>.’</p>

<p class="ti0">Considering the situation of the moment <span
class="m">117.8.7</span> must almost certainly mean <i>evacuate</i>,
<span class="m">1383</span> <i>Tagus</i>, and <span class="m">498</span>
some large town.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798"
class="fnanchor">[798]</a> [The particular dispatch in which this
occurs is on a most curious piece of paper, half an inch broad, a
foot long, and excessively thin. It is bent into twelve folds,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_614">[p. 614]</span> and would fit into any
small receptacle of one inch by half an inch. I fear the bearer who
had it on his person must have come to a bad end.] Suchet also made
Scovell the present of some useful words when he wrote on September 17
to Soult,</p>

<p class="cita">‘Le Général Maitland commande l’expédition anglaise
venue de <span class="m">747</span>: O’Donnell peut réunir <span
class="m">786 692 1102</span> en y comprenant le corps de l’Anglais
Roche. Le 19 août je n’avais que <span class="m">135 692 1102</span> à
lui opposer.’</p>

<p class="ti0">Here it is quite clear that ‘<span class="m">747</span>’
means <i>Sicily</i>; that ‘<span class="m">692.1102</span>’ in the two
statements of forces means <i>thousand men</i>. A little guessing and
comparison with other cryptic statements of forces would soon show that
<span class="m">135</span> meant 7 and <span class="m">786</span> meant
12.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding much useful help it was still a marvellous feat of
Scovell to work out by the end of 1812 no less than <i>nine hundred</i>
separate cipher-numbers, ranging in complexity from the simple vowel
a to the symbol that represented ‘train des équipages militaires’! He
must have had a most ingenious brain, and unlimited patience. Down
to the end there remained numbers of unsolved riddles, figures that
represented persons or places so unfrequently mentioned that there was
no way of discovering, by comparison between several documents, what
the number was likely to mean.</p>

<p>Sometimes very small fish came into the net of the guerrilleros,
and were sent on to Wellington; take, for example, the tiny scrap
containing the pathetic letter of the young wife of General Merlin, of
the cavalry of the Army of the Centre—I fear that the bearer must have
fallen into the hands of Julian Sanchez or one of his lieutenants, and
have had short shrift:—</p>

<p>‘Mon cher Ami,—Depuis ton départ je n’ai reçu qu’un seul mot de
toi—pendant qu’il arrive des courriers (c’est-à-dire des paysans)
du quartier général. Mon oncle qui écrit régulièrement dit toujours
qu’on se porte bien, mais tu peux te mettre à ma place! Je crains que
ta goutte ne soit revenue, je crains tant de choses, qui peut-être
passent le sens commun, mais qui me tourmentent. Je ne dors plus, et
n’ai d’autre plaisir que celui de regarder ma fille, qui se porte
bien. Encore si elle pouvait m’entendre et me consoler! Adieu! Je
suis d’une tristesse insupportable, parce que je t’aime plus que
moi-même.—Mercédes.’</p>

<p>It may suffice to show the general character of a typical
cipher-dispatch if we give a few lines of one, with the interpretation
added below—the following comes from a dispatch of Marmont written on
April 22, 1812, to Berthier, from Fuente Guinaldo:—</p>

<p class="mono">Le roi après m’avoir donné l’ordre</p>

<p class="mono">1060 462 &nbsp;810 &nbsp;195 1034 &nbsp; 1282<br />
&nbsp;de faire par- tir deux divisions</p>

<p class="mono">971 216 &nbsp;13 192 614 &nbsp;20 &nbsp;90 &nbsp;92<br />
&nbsp;et  plus de la &nbsp;moi- ti- é &nbsp;de la</p>

<p class="mono"> &nbsp; 1265 &nbsp; &nbsp;582 &nbsp;637 851 809 &nbsp;388 &nbsp;177<br />
cavalerie dis- po- ni- ble, &nbsp;et avoir</p>

<p class="mono">669 112 923 2 &nbsp;786 &nbsp; 692 &nbsp; 1102<br />
ré- du- &nbsp;it à douze mille hommes</p>

<p class="mono">le nombre de troupes que j’ai disponible m’ordonne</p>

<p class="mono">13 &nbsp; 1040 &nbsp;1003 &nbsp;370 860 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;400 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 817 &nbsp;69 862 718 1100<br />
de chercher &nbsp;à &nbsp;pren-dre Ciudad Rodrigo lors que je &nbsp;ne &nbsp;ai</p>

<p class="mono">423 815 &nbsp;591 &nbsp;710 &nbsp;850<br />
pas un &nbsp;canon &nbsp;de siège!</p>

<p>It will be noted that of all the words only <i>partir</i>, <i>moitié</i>,
<i>disponible</i>, <i>réduit</i>, <i>prendre</i>, required to be spelled out in
the syllabary: single fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">[p.
615]</span> numbers existing for all the common words, and for the
military terms <i>siège</i>, <i>cavalerie</i>, and <i>division</i>.</p>

<p>It was, of course, only by degrees that Scovell succeeded in making
out the bulk of the French phrases. In Wellington’s dispatches there is
often, during the spring and summer of 1812, an allusion to information
only partly comprehensible, obtained from captured letters. On June 18
(<i>Dispatches</i>, ix. p. 241) Wellington writes to Lord Liverpool that he
‘is not able entirely to decipher’ the intercepted papers that have
been passing between King Joseph and Soult and Marmont. On June 25th he
sends to the same recipient the happy intelligence that he has now the
key to King Joseph’s cipher. Yet again, on July 16th (<i>Dispatches</i>, ix.
p. 290)—with No. 36 of the file catalogued below before him—he says: ‘I
have this day got a letter from the King to Marmont of the 9th inst. in
cipher, which I cannot entirely decipher: it appears, however, that he
thinks Drouet will not cross the Tagus, and I suspect he orders General
Treillard to collect some troops in the valley of the Tagus, and to
move on Plasencia.’ The interpretation was correct, save that Treillard
was to move not on Plasencia but on Aranjuez. The code-numbers for the
two places were neither of them known as yet. But by September all
essential words were discovered, and Wellington could comprehend nearly
everything, unless Joseph or Soult was writing of obscure places or
distant generals.</p>

<p>A list of the whole of Scovell’s file of 52 French dispatches may be
useful: those whose number is marked with a star are wholly or partly
in cipher, the remaining minority are in plain French without disguise.
It is clear that Wellington had many more French papers not in cipher,
which did not get into Scovell’s portfolio.</p>

in the Peninsula only one (No. 4) was with the field army, that of
Captain F. Sympher, attached to the 4th Division. This unit was present

<i>Subsidios</i>.]</p>

<p class="mt1">Only three field batteries accompanied the allied field
army during the campaign of 1812, though seven had been at the front in
1811. These batteries were:—</p>

<p>Captain J. da Cunha Preto’s 6-pounder [from the 1st regiment] and
Captain W. Braun’s 9-pounder [from the 2nd regiment] batteries, both
attached to General Hamilton’s Portuguese division, which always acted
with Hill in Estremadura, and Major S. J. de Arriaga’s 24-pounder
howitzer battery, which formed part of the Artillery Reserve, and
accompanied Wellington’s own army to Badajoz, Salamanca, and Burgos.
This company came from the 1st (Lisbon) regiment.</p>

<p>But in addition the 2nd or Algarve regiment supplied one company,
under Captain J. C. Pereira do Amaral for the siege of Badajoz.</p>

<p>The 4th or Oporto regiment gave two companies (200 men) under
Captain J. V. Miron for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, and one (70 men)
under Captain William Cox for the siege of Badajoz. Cox’s company was
sent round to Alicante in June, along with the British companies of
Holcombe and Thompson, and joined Maitland’s Anglo-Sicilian corps for
the rest of the war.</p>

<p>Another company of the 4th regiment under Captain D. G. Ferreri
formed the divisional artillery of Silveira’s Militia corps, and was
present at the blockade of Zamora in June-July 1812.</p>

<p>The 1st or Lisbon regiment sent a company under Captain M. A. Penedo
to Alicante, along with the company of Cox mentioned above from the 4th
regiment. It also supplied one company under Lieutenant A. da Costa e
Silva for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>The 3rd or Elvas regiment supplied three companies, under the
command of Major A. Tulloh<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814"
class="fnanchor">[814]</a>, for the siege of Badajoz—they were those of
Captains A. V. Barreiros, J. Elizeu, and J. M. Delgado.</p>

<p id="Footnote_23"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_23">[23]</a></span> This indictment of Suchet must be
supported by details. In his elaborate table of casualties by corps
at the end of his dispatch of Oct. 20, he only allows for 3 officers
killed and 8 wounded, 40 men killed and 122 wounded—total 173. But the
lists of officers’ casualties in Martinien show, on the other hand,
<i>five</i> officers killed (Coutanceau, Saint Hilaire, Turno, Giardini,
Cuny), and at least <i>ten</i> wounded (Mathis, Durand, Gauchet, D’Autane,
Adhémar, Gattinara, Lamezan, D’Esclaibes, Maillard, Laplane), and
probably three more.</p>

<p class="ti1">Oddly enough, in his <i>Mémoires</i> (ii. p. 173) Suchet
gives <i>by name</i> four officers killed at the breach (out of the five),
while in his official report he had stated that there were only three
killed altogether. We must trust rather Vacani, an eye-witness and a
man much interested in statistics and casualties, when he gives the
total of 300 for the losses, than Suchet’s table.</p>

exact ‘morning state’ of Blake’s army, which is printed in the rare
Spanish government publication of 1822, <i>Estados de la Organizacion y
Fuerza de los Ejércitos Españoles</i>, pp. 184-7. Obispo had 3,400 men,
Miranda 4,000, Villacampa 3,350, Mahy 4,600 infantry, under Montijo and
Creagh, and 830 horse. This wing had 2 horse- and 2 field-batteries, 18

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_27"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_27">[27]</a></span> There are terrible difficulties as
to the timing of the battle of Saguntum. Suchet says that the first
engagement was between Obispo’s flanking division, coming over the
hills on the west, and Robert. Schepeler says that Obispo arrived too
late altogether, and was practically not in the fight (p. 472). I think
that the explanation is that Suchet took O’Ronan’s two battalions for
Obispo, because they came from the direction where he was expected. I
follow, in my timing of the battle, the very clear narrative of Vacani
(v. pp. 440-1), who seems to make it clear that the main fighting on
the French right was well over before that in the centre, and long
before that on the left. Schepeler (who rode with Blake that day) also
makes it certain that Lardizabal and Zayas were fighting long after
Miranda, Villacampa, and Mahy had been disposed of. But difficulties
remain, which could only be cleared up if we had a report by Obispo.
General Arteche thinks that the action began fairly simultaneously all
along the line, and follows Schepeler in saying that Obispo was late
(xi. p. 174), the very reverse of Suchet’s statement that he came, and
was beaten, too early.</p>

the cuirassiers comes from the <i>Mémoires</i> of Colonel de Gonneville,
who commanded their leading squadron. There is a curious point to be
settled here. Marshal Suchet says (<i>Mémoires</i>, ii. p. 185) that he
rode in person to the head of the regiment, and harangued it shortly
on Margalef and other ancient glories, before bidding it charge.
While speaking he was struck by a spent ball on the shoulder. But
de Gonneville (who had read Suchet’s book, as he quotes it in other
places) says distinctly (p. 208 of his <i>Souvenirs militaires</i>) that he
received no orders, and charged on his own responsibility. ‘N’ayant là
d’ordre à recevoir de personne, mais comprenant la nécessité d’arrêter
cette masse de cavalerie qui arrivait à nous, &amp;c. ... je donnai
le signal.’ Was Suchet romancing about his little speech? Or was de
Gonneville, who wrote his <i>Mémoires</i> forty years later, oblivious?
Either hypothesis is difficult.</p>

<p id="Footnote_123"><span class="label"><a

not be denied to the Spaniards. Napier, with his usual prejudice,
remarks (iv. p. 60) that Skerrett ‘assigned the charge of the breach
entirely to the Spaniards, and if Smith had not insisted upon placing
British troops alongside of them this would have ruined the defence,
because hunger and neglect had so broken the spirit of these poor men
that few appeared during the combat, and Copons alone displayed the
qualities of a gallant soldier.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_124"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_124">[124]</a></span> Skerrett and Copons estimated the
loss of the enemy at nearly 500, no doubt an exaggeration. But Leval’s
207 seems far too few. The commanding officer of the 51st Ligne reports
from his four flank-companies 7 officers and 81 men hit (Belmas, iv,
Appendix, p. 58). Of the sapper detachment which led the column,
from 50 men 43 were <i>hors de combat</i> (Belmas, iv. p. 31). It seems
incredible that when 23 companies took part in the assault 5 of them
should have suffered 131 casualties out of a total of 207. Martinien’s
tables show 18 officers killed and wounded on Dec. 31, a figure which
proves nothing, for though at the usual casualty rate of 20 men per
officer this would imply a total loss of 360, yet it is well known that
in assaults the officers often suffer a loss out of all proportion to
that of the rank and file. Eighteen officers hit might be compatible
with a loss as low as 200 or as high as 400 in such a case.</p>

Mackinnon as being killed by the first explosion, and others (including
Wellington’s dispatch) call the second explosion that of an expense
magazine fired by accident. Barrié’s report, however, settles the fact
that it was a regular mine: and for Mackinnon’s death <i>after</i> the
storming of the cuts I follow the narrative by an eye-witness appended
at the end of the general’s diary.</p>

shirking, but Geo. Napier writes (<i>Life</i>, p. 215), ‘Neither Elder nor
his excellent regiment were likely to neglect any duty, and I am sure
the blame rested elsewhere, for George Elder was always ready for any
service.’ Compare George Simmons’s autobiography—possibly he put things
out by ordering the Portuguese company to carry the ladders, which he
clearly was not authorized to do. [<i>A British Rifleman</i>, p. 221.]</p>

<p id="Footnote_192"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_192">[192]</a></span> The point has often been raised
as to whether it was not the success of the Light Division at the
lesser breach which enabled the 3rd Division to break through at the
greater. Some Light Division diarists (e.g. Harry Smith) actually state
that it was their attack on the rear of the defenders which made them
flinch from a position which they had hitherto maintained. I think that
the case is decided in favour of the 3rd Division by Belmas’s statement
that the French fired the mine at the great breach only when the 3rd
Division had got through, combined with the fact that the leading men
of the Light Division reached the back of the great breach just in time
to suffer from the explosion, which killed Captain Uniacke of the 95th
and a few others. Apparently, therefore, the breach was forced before
the head of the Light Division stormers had come up, but only just
before.</p>

in a small magazine under the rampart. ‘These desperate men, on seeing
an officer approach, deeming discovery and capture inevitable, and
assured that an ignominious death would follow, blew themselves up in
the magazine. The explosion first found vent through the door, and
shot the refugees up into the street, some alive, but so mutilated,
blackened, and distorted, as to be painful to behold.’</p>

comment on Marmont’s doings (vol. iv. pp. 94-5) seems to me to be
vitiated by a wish to vindicate Napoleon at all costs, and to throw
all possible blame on his lieutenant. His statements contain what I
cannot but call a <i>suggestio falsi</i>, when he says that ‘Bonnet quitted
the Asturias, Montbrun hastened back from Valencia, Dorsenne sent a
detachment in aid, and on Jan. 25 six divisions of infantry and one of
cavalry, 45,000 men in all, were assembled at Salamanca, from whence to
Ciudad is only four marches.’ This misses the facts that (1) Marmont
had only <i>four</i> divisions (Souham, Clausel, Maucune, and the weak
division of Thiébault); (2) that Bonnet had not arrived, nor could for
some days; (3) that Dorsenne sent nothing, and on Jan. 27 announced
that nothing would be forthcoming; (4) that Montbrun (who was at
Alicante on Jan. 16) was still far away on the borders of Murcia. With
22,000 men only in hand Marmont was naturally cautious.</p>

such a force was assembled, which it certainly was not, Wellington
reckoned that Marmont had Souham, Clausel, Maucune, Thiébault, and two
divisions from the East, which last had not really come up—and never
were to do so.</p>

posts of the Army of the Centre were 150 miles away from the Esla,
while the Army of the North at Burgos was much closer. Moreover,
the Army of the Centre had not two infantry divisions, but only
one—d’Armagnac’s—and some <i>Juramentado</i> regiments.</p>

movements of Wellington’s army on any march. For this particular
movement the whole of the detailed orders happen to have been preserved
in the D’Urban Papers. The starting-places of the units were:—</p>

<p class="ti1">1st Division—Gallegos, Carpio, Fuentes de Oñoro.</p>

<p class="ti1">3rd Division—Zamorra (by the Upper Agueda).</p>

<p class="ti1">4th Division—San Felices and Sesmiro.</p>

<p class="ti1">Light Division—Fuente Guinaldo.</p>

<p class="ti1">Bradford’s Portuguese—Barba del Puerco.</p>

<p class="ti1">Pack’s Portuguese—Campillo and Ituero.</p>

<p class="ti1">The marches were so arranged that the 7th Division
passed through Castello Branco on Feb. 26, the 6th Division on Feb. 29,
the Light Division on March 3, the 4th Division on March 5. All these
were up to Portalegre, Villa Viçosa, or Castello de Vide, in touch with
Elvas, by March 8. The 1st Division, coming by way of Abrantes, joined
on March 10. Pack and Bradford, who had very circuitous routes, the one
by Coimbra, the other by Thomar, were not up till several days later
(16th). The 5th Division did not leave Rodrigo till March 9.</p>

make out that Wellington’s siege began ten days later than he wished
and hoped, by the fault of the Portuguese Regency. I cannot see how
Badajoz could have been invested on the 6th of March, when (as the
route-directions show) the head of the marching column from the Agueda
only reached Portalegre on the 8th. The movement of the army was not
delayed, so far as I can see, by the slackness of Portuguese management
at Lisbon or Elvas. But Wellington certainly grumbled. Did he intend
that Hill alone should invest Badajoz, before the rest of the army
arrived?</p>

1,500 strong, the fourth being left at Jaen. Soult says in his dispatch
of April 8 that he took a whole <i>brigade</i> from Leval, but the states
of April 14 show the 32nd and 58th regiments of Leval’s division, and
three of the four battalions of the 43rd, all left in the kingdom of
Granada. Apparently three battalions of the 55th and one of the 43rd
marched, about 2,200 strong.</p>

<p id="Footnote_296"><span class="label"><a

as more likely.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_297"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_297">[297]</a></span> The orders to Hill issued by
Wellington on April 4 and 5 (<i>Dispatches</i>, ix. p. 30) contemplate
two possibilities: (1) Soult is marching with his whole force on
Villafranca, and Foy is remaining far away: in this case Hill is to
move <i>en masse</i> on Albuera. This is the case that actually occurred;
(2) if Foy is moving toward the Upper Guadiana, and Soult is showing
signs of extending to join him, Howard’s British and Ashworth’s
Portuguese brigades and Campbell’s Portuguese horse will stay at Merida
as long as is prudent, in order to prevent the junction, and will break
the bridge at the last moment and then follow Hill.</p>

<p class="ti1">Wellington, when he wrote his first orders of the 4th
to Hill, was intending to storm Badajoz on the 5th, and knew, by
calculating distances, that Soult could not be in front of Albuera till
the 7th. He ultimately chanced another day of bombardment, running the
time limit rather fine. But there was no real risk with Graham and Hill
at Albuera: Soult could not have forced them.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_298"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_298">[298]</a></span> He says in his letter to Berthier
of April 8 that he had intended (but for the fall of Badajoz) to
move by his right that morning, to the lower course of the Guadajira
river—which would have brought on an action near Talavera Real, lower
down the stream of the Albuera than the battle-spot of May 1811.</p>

about these subsidized corps is the life of Sir Samford Whittingham,
who raised and disciplined one of them in Majorca, on the skeletons of
the old regiments of Cordova, Burgos, and 5th Granaderos Provinciales.
He had only 1,500 men on January 1, 1812, and 2,200 on February 21, but
had worked them up to over 3,000 by April. Roche, who had to work on
the cadres of Canarias, Alicante, Chinchilla, Voluntarios de Aragon,
2nd of Murcia, and Corona, had 5,500 men ready on March 1, and more by
May. Whittingham maintains that his battalions always did their duty
far better than other divisions, commanded by officers with unhappy
traditions of defeat, and attributes the previous miserable history of
the Murcian army to incapacity and poor spirit in high places.</p>

of politics,’ Sir Robert Wilson, was passing through Sicily in May,
and seems to have acted a mischievous part in visiting the Queen, and
allowing her to set before him all her grievances against Bentinck,
and the ‘Jacobin Parliament’ that he was setting up. She told Wilson
that Bentinck ‘went to jails and took evidence of miserable wretches,
actual malefactors or suspects, inducing them to say what he wished
for his plans, and acting without any substantiating facts.’ As to the
army Wilson gathered that ‘the Neapolitan soldiery hate us to a man,
the Germans would adhere to us, the native Sicilians at least not act
against us.’ But there were only 2,000 Sicilians and 1,900 Germans,
and 8,000 Neapolitans and other Italians, eminently untrustworthy.
[So untrustworthy were they, indeed, that the Italian corps sent to
Spain in the autumn deserted by hundreds to the French.] See Wilson’s

Benavente were the most distant points: but the troops from them were

would give an army of some 35,000 or 36,000 in all. But the returns
(see <a href="#ChapA_11">Appendix</a>) indicate a higher figure for the
infantry; after all deductions for detachments, garrisons, and sick
have been made, it looks as if there must have been 33,000 or even
34,000 available. Generals with a ‘point to prove’ are always a little
easy with their figures.</p>

discounted by the fact that it had not one man killed or wounded—the
5th Division had only two (in the 3rd Royal Scots), the 4th Division
over 200; and though most of them fell in the last charge, a good

found in Greville’s <i>Memoirs</i>, ii. p. 39. Wellington is said to have
been in the courtyard of a farmhouse, where some food had been laid out
for him, ‘stumping about and munching,’ and taking occasional peeps
through his telescope. Presently came the aide-de-camp with Leith’s
message. Wellington took another long look through his glass, and
cried, ‘By God! that will do!’ his mouth still full. He then sprang
on his horse and rode off, the staff following. Another version may
be found in Grattan, pp. 239-40: ‘Lord W. had given his glass to an
aide-de-camp, while he himself sat down to eat a few mouthfuls of
cold beef. Presently the officer reported that the enemy were still
extending to their left. “The devil they are! give me the glass
quickly,” said his lordship—and then, after a long inspection, “This
will do at last, I think—ride off.”’</p>

as the hour, since Maucune only left the woods at 2 o’clock, and had
to march on to the plateau, to take up his position, to send out his
<i>voltigeurs</i>, and to get them close in to Arapiles before he would have
sent such a message to his chief. Foy says ‘between 3 and 4 p.m.’</p>

<p id="Footnote_543"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_543">[543]</a></span> The exact moment of Marmont’s
wound is very difficult to fix, as also that of Wellington’s attack.
The Marshal himself (as mentioned above, p.438) says that he was hit
‘environ les trois heures,’ and that Leith and Cole advanced ‘peu
après, sur les quatre heures.’ Foy places the wound merely ‘between 3
and 4 p.m.’ Parquin, who commanded Marmont’s escort of <i>chasseurs</i>,
says that the Marshal had been carried back to Alba de Tormes by 4
o’clock—impossibly early. On the other hand Napier gives too late
an hour, when saying that Marmont was wounded only at the moment
when Leith and Cole advanced, 4.45 or so, and was running down from
the Arapile because of their movement. This is, I imagine, much too
late. But it is supported by <i>Victoires et Conquêtes</i>, sometimes a
well-documented work but often inaccurate, which places the unlucky
shot at 4.30. Grattan places the order to the British infantry (Leith
and Cole) to prepare to attack at 4.20—Leith Hay at ‘at least an hour
after 3 o’clock.’ Gomm, on the other hand, makes Wellington move ‘at
3 o’clock in the afternoon.’ Tomkinson (usually very accurate) places
Pakenham’s and Leith’s success at ‘about 5 p.m.’ D’Urban thinks that he
met Lord Wellington and received his orders <i>after</i> 4 p.m.—probably he
is half an hour too late in his estimate.</p>

<p id="Footnote_544"><span class="label"><a

squadrons formed the outer two, but the fact that Power’s Portuguese
followed Wallace in the 3rd column only emerges in the Regimental
History of the 45th (Dalbiac), p. 103. This is quite consistent with

front, so that the senior regiment was in the rear. The fourth unit of
the division (23rd Léger) was absent, garrisoning Astorga, as was also
the 2nd battalion of the 1st, which was a very strong four-battalion
corps. Hence there were only 8 battalions out of 11 present, or 4,300
men out of 6,200.</p>

than any other 3rd Division regiment except the 88th. Sergeant Morley
of the 5th, its only Salamanca diarist, writes (p. 113): ‘There was
a pause—a hesitation. Here I blush—but I should blush more if I were
guilty of a falsehood. We retired—slowly, in good order, not far, not
100 paces. General Pakenham approached, and very good-naturedly said
“re-form,” and after a moment “advance—there they are, my lads—let them
feel the temper of your bayonets.” We advanced—rather slowly at first,
a regiment of dragoons which had retired with us again accompanying ...
and took our retribution for our repulse.’ The dragoon regiment was
presumably part of D’Urban’s brigade.</p>

Arentschildt on the doings of his brigade: it is not mentioned by
Napier, nor is there anything about it in Wellington’s dispatch. The

on the first hill.’ He says that he closed with the main body of the
French horse and drove it off.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_552"><span class="label"><a

three regiments were, taking killed and wounded only, not unwounded
prisoners, 25 for the 101st, 15 for the 62nd, 5 for the 1st, by
Martinien’s lists. The British returns of prisoners sent to England,
at the Record Office, show 6 officers from the 101st, 2 from the 62nd,
and 1 from the 1st, received after the battle. I presume that nearly
all the wounded, both officers and rank and file, count among the
prisoners. The 1st entered in its regimental report 176 <i>tués ou pris</i>,
22 <i>blessés</i>, 29 <i>disparus</i>: here the only people who got away would be
the 22 <i>blessés</i>. The regimental return of the 101st shows 31 officers
wanting—which seems to correspond to the 25 killed and wounded plus the
6 prisoners sent to England.</p>

<p id="Footnote_562"><span class="label"><a

neither the 22nd nor the 66th was among the fourteen Salamanca
regiments of which detailed casualty lists survive. The 15th Line
returned 15 officers and 359 men as their loss. Martinien’s tables
show 21 officers lost in the 22nd, and 17 in the 66th. The deficits
of these two regiments as shown by the muster-rolls of August 1 were
respectively about 750 and 500, but these do not represent their total
losses, as all the regiments present at the battle had picked up many
men at their dépôts at Valladolid, and from the small evacuated posts,
before August 1, e.g. the 15th had 52 officers present on July 15,
lost 15 at Salamanca, but showed 46 present on August 1; 9 officers
must have joined from somewhere in the interim. So the 66th had 38
officers present on July 15, lost 17, but showed 34 present on August
1. Thirteen more must have arrived, and accompanied of course by the
corresponding rank and file.</p>

Great Arapile, lost only 8 officers—but 580 men, an almost inexplicable

Ligne 17 officers and 253 men. The 50th, which had 26 officers hit,

probable’ that Clausel will move, in a letter to Santocildes sent off
the very next day, he remarks that an advance from Burgos into the
kingdom of Leon, to relieve Astorga, is ‘most likely.’ I fancy that the
former was his real opinion, and that the latter was spoken of with
some stress in the directions to Santocildes, mainly because Wellington
wished to impress on the Spaniard the duty of being cautious and
retiring to the Esla without offering battle.</p>

showing very weak battalions, owing to their dreadful Badajoz losses;
and the former had also suffered very severely (1,000 casualties) at
Salamanca. The 5th and 3rd had comparatively moderate casualties at
each of these fights, but the combination of the two successive sets of
losses had reduced them very considerably.</p>

Estremadura] will also co-operate in it.’ The see-saw of alternate
distractions is clearly laid down—but Ballasteros (as usual) proved a
difficult factor to manage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_680"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_680">[680]</a></span> In this report (the copy of which
I owe to Mr. Fortescue’s kindness) Drouet says that Soult had told him
to expect reinforcements to the total of some 15,000 men, but that
Barrois brought him only 3,500 infantry and 1,500 horse, and Daricau
4,500 infantry and 1,000 horse, so that his reinforcements were only
10,500 men instead of 15,000. Drouet stated his own force, horse and
foot (his own division and Lallemand’s cavalry) in a preceding letter
of June 9th at 6,000 of all arms, so that the concentration would only
give 16,000 men. I fancy that he is deliberately understating Barrois,
for that general had 7,000 men in March, and 5,000 still in October
at the end of a long and fatiguing campaign, and Pierre Soult too.
Drouet’s object in giving these figures to Joseph was to prove that he
was so weak that he could make no detachment towards the Tagus, as the
King had directed him to do. Was it for the same purpose that he always
over-stated Hill’s army? Or did he really believe that the latter had
30,000 men arranged opposite him, as he repeatedly told Soult?</p>

<p id="Footnote_734"><span class="label"><a

dreadful plot was said to have been formed in Barcelona, with the
knowledge and approval of Lacy—arsenic was to be mixed with the flour
of the garrison’s rations by secret agents. [See Suchet’s <i>Mémoires</i>,
ii. p. 256, and Arteche, xii. p. 353.] How far the plan was a reality
is difficult to decide. There is a large file of papers in the Paris
War Office concerning experiments carried out by a commission of
army-doctors, in consequence of a sudden outbreak of sickness among the
troops in July. One or two soldiers died, a great number were seized
with vomiting and stomach-cramps; poison being suspected, the doctors
took possession of the flour, attempted to analyse it, and tried its
effects on a number of street dogs. A few of the animals died: most
were violently sick, but got over the dose. Poison was not definitely
proved, and dirty utensils and bad baking might conceivably have been
the cause of the outbreak. Some Catalan writers say that there was
a poisoning-plot, or I should have doubted the whole story. See the
Appendix to Arteche, xii. p. 483.</p>
